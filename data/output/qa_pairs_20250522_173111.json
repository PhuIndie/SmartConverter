Inheritance allows for the creation of\nhierarchical relationships between classes, with parent classes\npassing down their characteristics to their child classes.\nPolymorphism: Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects to\ntake on many forms, and is achieved through the use of inheritance,\noverloading and overriding methods, and interfaces. Polymorphism\nallows for greater flexibility and reuse of code.\nAbstraction: Abstraction refers to the process of identifying\ncommon patterns and extracting essential features of objects,\ncreating classes from these patterns. Abstraction allows for the\ncreation of higher-level concepts that can be used in multiple\ncontexts, and can simplify complex systems.",

    "answer": "While abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly, their\nconstructors play a crucial role in object initialization within\ninheritance hierarchies. Here are the key purposes of constructors in\nabstract classes:\nInitializing Member Variables:\nAbstract classes often have member variables that need to\nbe initialized for proper object state. Constructors perform\nthis initialization, ensuring consistent setup for all\nsubclasses.\nExample: An abstract Shape class might have a color\nproperty initialized in its constructor.\nEnforcing Invariants and Constraints:\nConstructors can enforce rules and constraints that must\nhold true for all objects in the hierarchy. This ensures data\nintegrity and validity.\nExample: A BankAccount abstract class might require a\nnon-negative initial balance in its constructor.\nShared Initialization Logic:\nCommon initialization steps for all subclasses can be\nconsolidated in the abstract class constructor, reducing\ncode duplication.\nExample: An Employee abstract class might initialize a\nhireDate property in its constructor, shared by all\nemployee types.\nControlling Instantiation:\nConstructors can be made private or protected to control\nhow subclasses are created, ensuring they are instantiated\nthrough specific mechanisms or helper methods.\nExample: A Singleton abstract class might have a private\nconstructor to enforce a single instance.\nCalling Superclass Constructors:\nSubclasses must call their superclass constructor (implicitly\nor explicitly) during their own construction. This ensures\nproper initialization of inherited state.\nExample: A SavingsAccount subclass must call the\nBankAccount constructor to initialize shared account\nproperties.\nKey Points:\nAbstract class constructors are not used for object creation\ndirectly, but they are invoked when a subclass object is\ncreated.\nThey ensure consistent initialization and enforce class\ninvariants, promoting code reusability and maintainability.\nUnderstanding constructor behaviour in abstract classes is\nessential for effective object-oriented design.",

    "answer": "Abstraction allows you to break down complex systems\ninto smaller, easier-to-understand pieces.\nYou define interfaces or classes that expose only the\nrelevant functionalities, hiding the inner workings.\nThis lets you work with the system at a higher level,\nwithout getting bogged down in the low-level details.\nThink of it this way:\nImagine a car. You don't need to understand the intricate\nmechanics of the engine to drive it.

You simply call\nits functions or methods and interact with it at a higher\nlevel.\nAdvantages of abstraction:\nReduced complexity: It makes your code easier to\nunderstand, write, and maintain by breaking down large\nproblems into smaller, more manageable chunks.\nIncreased productivity: You can focus on the logic and\nfunctionality of your program without getting bogged\ndown in implementation details.\nImproved reusability: Abstracted components can be used\nin multiple parts of your program, reducing code\nduplication and promoting modularity.\nEnhanced readability: Code becomes more concise and\nless cluttered, making it easier for others to understand\nand collaborate on.\nFlexibility and adaptability: Abstractions allow you to\nchange the underlying implementation without affecting\nthe code that uses them.\nHere are some specific examples of abstraction in programming:\nFunctions: They hide the implementation details of a\nspecific task and provide a simple interface for other parts\nof your program to interact with.\nClasses: They bundle related data and functionality,\nmaking it easier to manage and reuse complex data\nstructures.\nLibraries and frameworks: They provide pre-built\nabstractions for common tasks, saving you time and effort.",

    "answer": "Multilevel inheritance is a type of inheritance in object-oriented\nprogramming (OOP) where a derived class (subclass) is created from\nanother derived class, which itself was derived from a base class\n(superclass).\nIn multilevel inheritance, each derived class inherits the\ncharacteristics of the class above it in the hierarchy. This means that\na subclass not only has all the features of its immediate superclass,\nbut also those of all its ancestors up the hierarchy chain.\nHere's an example to illustrate multilevel inheritance:\nclass Animal {\nvoid eat() {\nSystem.out.println(\"Eating...\");\n}\n}\nclass Dog extends Animal {\nvoid bark() {\nSystem.out.println(\"Barking...\");\n}\n}\nclass Bulldog extends Dog {\nvoid guard() {\nSystem.out.println(\"Guarding...\");\n}\n}\nIn this example, Animal is the base class, Dog is a derived class from\nAnimal, and Bulldog is a derived class from Dog.\nAnimal has a single method eat(). Dog inherits eat() from Animal\nand adds a new method bark(). Bulldog inherits both eat() and\nbark() from Dog and adds a new method guard().\nNow, an instance of Bulldog can access all the methods of its\nimmediate superclass (Dog), as well as all the methods of its\nancestor superclass (Animal). For example:\nBulldog bulldog = new Bulldog();\nbulldog.eat(); // output: Eating...\nbulldog.bark(); // output: Barking...\nbulldog.guard(); // output: Guarding...\nThis example demonstrates how multilevel inheritance can be used\nto create a hierarchy of classes that inherit and extend behavior\nfrom each other.

    "answer": "Encapsulation and abstraction are two important concepts in object-\noriented programming, and they are used in different ways in\ndifferent parts of a project.\nEncapsulation is used to protect the internal state of an object and\nto control how other objects can access or modify that state. It is\ntypically used in data modelling, where we define classes that\nrepresent real-world entities and their properties.\nFor example, if we were building a system to manage a library, we\nmight define a Book class that has properties like title, author, and\nisbn. We would use encapsulation to ensure that these properties\nare not accessible or modifiable from outside the Book class, except\nthrough carefully designed methods like getTitle() and setAuthor().\nAbstraction, on the other hand, is used to hide the implementation\ndetails of a class or component and to present a simpler, higher-level\ninterface to other parts of the system. It is typically used in system\ndesign and architecture, where we define components and their\ninterfaces.\nFor example, if we were building a web application, we might define\na UserService component that provides methods for creating,\nupdating, and retrieving user accounts. We would use abstraction to\nensure that other components in the system do not need to know\nhow the UserService is implemented, but can simply use its interface\nto perform the necessary actions.\nIn general, encapsulation and abstraction are used together in\nobject-oriented programming to create robust, maintainable, and\nscalable systems. Encapsulation is used to protect the internal state\nof objects and to control how other objects can access or modify\nthat state, while abstraction is used to hide the implementation\ndetails of components and to present a simpler, higher-level interface\nto other parts of the system.",

  {
    "question": "How do you achieve encapsulation?",
    "answer": "Encapsulation is achieved in Java through the use of access\nmodifiers and getter and setter methods.\nAccess modifiers control the visibility of variables and\nmethods in a class. There are three access modifiers in Java:\npublic, private, and protected.\nPublic: Public variables and methods can be accessed from\nanywhere in the program.\nPrivate: Private variables and methods can only be accessed within\nthe same class.\nProtected: Protected variables and methods can be accessed within\nthe same class, and by subclasses and classes in the same package.\nBy default, if you don't specify an access modifier, the variable or\nmethod is considered to have \"package\" or \"default\" access, which\nmeans it can be accessed within the same package.\nHere's an example of how to use access modifiers to achieve\nencapsulation:\npublic class Person {\nprivate String name;\nprivate int age;\npublic String getName() {\nreturn name;\n}\npublic void setName(String name) {\nthis.name = name;\n}\npublic int getAge() {\nreturn age;\n}\npublic void setAge(int age) {\nif (age < 0) {\nthrow new IllegalArgumentException(\"Age cannot be\nnegative\");\n}\nthis.age = age;\n}\n}\nIn this example, the Person class has two private variables, name\nand age. These variables are not directly accessible from outside the\nclass, which means that other classes cannot modify or access them\ndirectly.\nTo allow other classes to access these variables, we provide public\ngetter and setter methods for name and age. The getter methods\nallow other classes to retrieve the values of these variables, while\nthe setter methods allow other classes to modify their values.\nNote that we can also add validation logic to the setter methods to\nensure that the values being set are valid. In this example, the\nsetAge method throws an exception if the age is negative.\nBy using access modifiers and getter and setter methods, we can\nachieve encapsulation in Java. This allows us to protect the data and\nbehavior of our objects and prevent other objects from accessing or\nmodifying them directly, which makes our code more robust and\nmaintainable.",

It allows us to write code\nthat can work with objects of different types in a uniform way,\nwithout needing to know the specific class of each object.\nIn Java, polymorphism is achieved through two mechanisms:\nmethod overloading and method overriding.\nMethod overloading is when a class has two or more methods with\nthe same name, but different parameters. When a method is called,\nthe compiler determines which method to call based on the number\nand types of the arguments passed to it.\npublic class Calculator {\npublic int add(int x, int y) {\nreturn x + y;\n}\npublic double add(double x, double y) {\nreturn x + y;\n}\n}\nIn this example, the Calculator class has two methods named add,\none that takes two integers and one that takes two doubles.

This is also\nknown as \"compile-time polymorphism\" or \"function overloading\" in\nsome languages. For example, a class Calculator might have multiple\nmethods with the name add, but with different parameters such as\nadd (int a, int b) and add (double a, double b).\nMethod overriding is the ability of a subclass to provide a different\nimplementation of a method that is already provided by its\nsuperclass. This is also known as \"runtime polymorphism\" or\n\"function overriding\". The method in the subclass has the same\nname, return type and parameters as the method in the superclass.\nThe purpose of method overriding is to change the behaviour of the\nmethod in the subclass.\nHere's an example of Overloading:\npublic class Calculator {\npublic int add(int x, int y) {\nreturn x + y;\n}\npublic int add(int x, int y, int z) {\nreturn x + y + z;\n}\npublic double add(double x, double y) {\nreturn x + y;\n}\n}\nIn this example, Calculator defines three different add() methods\nwith the same name but different parameters. The first method\ntakes two int arguments, the second takes three int arguments, and\nthe third takes two double arguments. The compiler decides which\nmethod to call based on the number and type of arguments passed\nto it.\nMethod overriding, on the other hand, is the ability to define a\nmethod in a subclass that has the same name and parameters as a\nmethod in its superclass. When the method is called on an object of\nthe subclass, the method in the subclass is executed instead of the\nmethod in the superclass.\nHere's an example overriding:\npublic class Animal {\npublic void makeSound() {\nSystem.out.println(\"The animal makes a sound\");\n}\n}\npublic class Dog extends Animal {\n@Override\npublic void makeSound() {\nSystem.out.println(\"The dog barks\");\n}\n}\nIn this example, Animal defines a makeSound() method that prints a\nmessage.

    "answer": "In Java, method overriding is when a subclass provides its own\nimplementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\nThe subclass method must have the same name, return type, and\nparameter list as the superclass method.\nAccess specifiers determine the visibility of a method, and they can\nalso be used when overriding methods. When overriding a method,\nthe access specifier of the overriding method cannot be more\nrestrictive than the access specifier of the overridden method. In\nother words, if the overridden method is public, the overriding\nmethod must also be public or less restrictive.\nHere is an example of method overriding with access specifiers:\npublic class Animal {\npublic void speak() {\nSystem.out.println(\"Animal speaks\");\n}\nprotected void eat() {\nSystem.out.println(\"Animal eats\");\n}\n}\npublic class Dog extends Animal {\n@Override\npublic void speak() {\nSystem.out.println(\"Dog barks\");\n}\n@Override\nprotected void eat() {\nSystem.out.println(\"Dog eats\");\n}\n}\nIn this example, the Animal class has a method named speak that is\npublic, and a method named eat that is protected.

The IOException is a\nsubclass of Exception, so this is allowed.\nThe eat method in the Dog class overrides the eat method in the\nAnimal class but does not throw any exceptions.\nWhen calling these methods, we can catch the exceptions that are\nthrown.

If the\nspeak method in the Dog class threw a different type of exception,\nsuch as RuntimeException, it would not be caught by this catch\nblock.\nThe eat method in the Dog class does not throw any exceptions, so\nthe catch block for Exception will not be executed.

    "answer": "SOLID is an acronym that represents five principles of object-\noriented design that aim to make software more maintainable,\nflexible, and easy to understand. Here are the explanations of each\nof the five SOLID principles, along with examples:\nSingle Responsibility Principle (SRP): This principle states that\na class should have only one reason to change. In other words, a\nclass should have only one responsibility or job. For example, if we\nhave a class named User, it should only be responsible for handling\nuser-related functionalities such as authentication, user data\nmanagement, etc. It should not be responsible for other unrelated\nfunctionalities like sending emails or managing payment\ntransactions.\nOpen/Closed Principle (OCP): This principle states that a class\nshould be open for extension but closed for modification. This means\nthat we should be able to add new functionalities or behaviors to a\nclass without changing its existing code. For example, instead of\nmodifying an existing Payment class to add support for a new\npayment method, we can create a new PaymentMethod class that\nimplements a Payment interface and inject it into the Payment class.\nLiskov Substitution Principle (LSP): This principle states that\nderived classes should be able to replace their base classes without\naffecting the correctness of the program. In other words, if we have\na base class Animal and a derived class Dog, we should be able to\nuse the Dog class wherever we use the Animal class. For example, if\nwe have a method that takes an Animal parameter and performs\nsome action, we should be able to pass a Dog object to that method\nwithout any issues.\nInterface Segregation Principle (ISP): This principle states that\na class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.\nIn other words, we should separate interfaces that are too large or\ngeneral into smaller and more specific interfaces. For example,\ninstead of having a single Payment interface that includes all\npayment methods, we can have separate interfaces like\nCreditCardPayment, PayPalPayment, etc.\nDependency Inversion Principle (DIP): This principle states\nthat high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.\nInstead, both should depend on abstractions. This means that we\nshould rely on abstractions, rather than concrete implementations.\nFor example, instead of depending on a specific database\nimplementation in a class, we should depend on a database\ninterface, which can be implemented by different databases.

    "question": "What is Cohesion and Coupling?",
    "answer": "Cohesion refers to the degree to which the elements within a\nmodule or component work together to achieve a single, well-\ndefined purpose. High cohesion means that the elements within a\nmodule are strongly related and work together towards a common\ngoal, while low cohesion means that the elements are loosely related\nand may not have a clear purpose.\nCoupling, on the other hand, refers to the degree of\ninterdependence between modules or components. High coupling\nmeans that a change in one module or component will likely affect\nother modules or components, while low coupling means that\nchanges in one module or component will have minimal impact on\nother modules or components.\nIn general, software design principles strive for high cohesion and\nlow coupling, as this leads to code that is more modular,\nmaintainable, and easier to understand and change.",

    "question": "What does Static keyword signify?",
    "answer": "In Java, the static keyword is used to create variables, methods, and\nblocks that belong to the class, rather than to an instance of the\nclass. When a variable or method is declared as static, it is\nassociated with the class and not with individual objects of the class.\nHere are some common uses of the static keyword:\nStatic variables: A static variable is a variable that belongs to the\nclass and is shared by all instances of the class. Static variables are\ndeclared using the static keyword and are often used for constants\nor for variables that need to be shared across instances of the class.\npublic class Example {\npublic static int count = 0;\n}\nIn this example, the count variable is declared as static, so it belongs\nto the Example class and is shared by all instances of the class.\nStatic methods: A static method is a method that belongs to the\nclass and can be called without creating an instance of the class.\nStatic methods are declared using the static keyword and are often\nused for utility methods that do not depend on the state of an\ninstance.\npublic class Example {\npublic static void printMessage(String message) {\nSystem.out.println(message);\n}\n}\nIn this example, the printMessage() method is declared as static, so\nit belongs to the Example class and can be called without creating\nan instance of the class.\nStatic blocks: A static block is a block of code that is executed when\nthe class is loaded. Static blocks are used to initialize static variables\nor to perform other one-time initialization tasks.\npublic class Example {\nstatic {\nSystem.out.println(\"Initializing Example class\");\n}\n}\nIn this example, the static block is executed when the Example class\nis loaded and prints a message to the console.\nIn summary, the static keyword is used to create variables, methods,\nand blocks that belong to the class, rather than to an instance of the\nclass. This allows these elements to be shared by all instances of the\nclass and to be accessed without creating an instance of the class.",

    "question": "How does HashMap work internally?",
    "answer": "A HashMap in Java is a data structure that stores key-value pairs and\nis implemented using a hash table. It uses a hash function to map\nkeys to indices in an array, called a bucket. The hash function takes\na key as input and returns an index, called a hash code, which is\nused to determine the location of the key-value pair in the bucket.\nInternally, a HashMap consists of an array of Entry objects, where\neach Entry object stores a key-value pair and a reference to the next\nEntry object in the same bucket. When a key-value pair is added to\nthe HashMap, the hash function is used to calculate the hash code of\nthe key, which is used to determine the index of the bucket in the\narray. If there is no Entry object at that index, a new Entry object is\ncreated and added to the array. If there is already an Entry object at\nthat index, the new key-value pair is added to the linked list of Entry\nobjects at that index.\nWhen a key-value pair is retrieved from the HashMap, the hash\nfunction is used to calculate the hash code of the key, which is used\nto determine the index of the bucket in the array. The linked list of\nEntry objects at that index is then searched for the key-value pair\nthat has the same key as the one being retrieved.\nThe HashMap uses an array and linked list, which allows for\nconstant-time O(1) performance for basic operations like put() and\nget() in an average case, and O(n) in the worst case when there's a\nhigh number of collisions. The load factor is a metric that determines\nwhen the HashMap should resize the array to maintain good\nperformance. The default load factor is 0.75, which means that\nwhen the number of key-value pairs in the HashMap exceeds 75% of\nthe size of the array, the array is resized to prevent excessive\ncollisions.\nExplain the internal implementation of HashMap.\nHashMap is a popular data structure in Java known for its efficient\nkey-value storage and retrieval. Understanding its internal\nimplementation can shed light on its performance characteristics and\ntrade-offs. Here's a breakdown:\nKey Components:\nHash Table: HashMap uses an array of buckets called a hash table\nto store key-value pairs. The size of this array plays a crucial role in\nperformance.\nNodes: Each key-value pair is stored in a \"Node\" object. This node\ncontains the key, value, hashcode of the key, and a reference to the\nnext node (for collision resolution).\nHash Function: This function converts the key into an integer\nindex within the hash table range. A good hash function minimizes\ncollisions, where multiple keys map to the same index.\nCollision Resolution Strategy: When collisions occur, HashMap\nemploys a strategy to store additional nodes at the same index.\nCommon strategies include chaining (using linked lists) and open\naddressing (probing for empty slots).\nSteps involved in operations:\nput(key, value):\nCalculate the hashcode of the key.\nUse the hash function to find the corresponding index in\nthe hash table.\nIf no nodes exist at that index, add a new node with the\nkey-value pair.\nIf a collision occurs:\n1. Chaining: Add the new node to the linked list at the\nindex.\n2. Open addressing: Probe for an empty slot nearby\nusing a specific strategy.\nget(key):\nCalculate the hashcode of the key.\nUse the hash function to find the corresponding index in\nthe hash table.\nTraverse the linked list (if chaining) or probe for the\nmatching key (open addressing).\nIf the key is found, return the associated value. Otherwise,\nreturn null.\nImportant:\nHashMap performance relies heavily on a good hash\nfunction and efficient collision resolution.\nChaining is generally preferred for smaller HashMaps due\nto its simplicity, while open addressing can be faster for\nlarger ones with a well-chosen probing strategy.\nThe load factor (number of entries divided by the table\nsize) affects performance. Rehashing occurs when the\nload factor exceeds a threshold, dynamically resizing the\ntable to maintain efficiency.",

    "question": "How does HashSet works internally?",
    "answer": "A HashSet is a collection class in Java that implements the Set\ninterface. It stores a collection of unique elements, which means\nthat it does not allow duplicate elements. The HashSet class\ninternally uses a HashMap to store the elements.\nWhen an element is added to the HashSet, it is first passed through\na hash function which calculates a unique hash code for the\nelement. This hash code is used as the key in the underlying\nHashMap, and the element is used as the value.\nWhen an element is retrieved from the HashSet, the hash code of\nthe element is calculated and used to look up the corresponding\nvalue in the underlying HashMap. If the value is found, it is returned,\notherwise, it means the element is not present in the HashSet.\nThe HashSet class uses the equals() method to compare the\nelements for equality. When an element is added to the HashSet, the\nHashSet calls the equals() method to check if the element is already\npresent in the HashSet. If the element is already present, it is not\nadded to the HashSet, otherwise, it is added to the HashSet.\nThe HashSet class also uses the hashCode() method to determine\nthe position of an element in the underlying HashMap. The\nhashCode() method returns an integer value, which is used as the\nindex of the element in the HashMap.\nIt's important to notice that the performance of HashSet depends on\nthe implementation of the hashCode() method. If the hashCode()\nmethod is implemented poorly, it could lead to many elements being\nstored in the same bucket, which can cause performance issues.\nIt's also worth mentioning that the HashSet is not thread-safe, if\nmultiple threads are accessing a HashSet at the same time, it's\nnecessary to use synchronization or other thread-safe collections like\nConcurrentHashSet.",

    "question": "What is the difference between comparable and comparator?",
    "answer": "In Java, both Comparable and Comparator are interfaces that are\nused to compare objects and establish their order in collections like\nlists or arrays. However, they serve different purposes and are used\nin different contexts:\n1. Comparable:\nThe Comparable interface is used to define the natural ordering of\nobjects. When a class implements the Comparable interface, it\nindicates that instances of that class have a default way to be\nsorted. The natural ordering is defined by implementing the\ncompareTo() method, which returns a negative integer if the current\nobject is \"less than\" the other object, zero if they are \"equal,\" and a\npositive integer if the current object is \"greater than\" the other\nobject.\nFor example, consider a Person class that implements Comparable to\nsort instances based on their age:\npublic class Person implements Comparable<Person> {\nprivate String name;\nprivate int age;\n// Constructor, getters, and setters\n@Override\npublic int compareTo(Person otherPerson) {\nreturn Integer.compare(this.age, otherPerson.age);\n}\n}\nBy implementing Comparable, instances of the Person class can be\nsorted using methods like Collections.sort() or Arrays.sort() without\nneeding to provide a separate comparator.\n2. Comparator:\nThe Comparator interface, on the other hand, is used to provide\ncustom comparison logic for objects that may not have a natural\nordering or when you want to sort objects based on different criteria\nthan their inherent properties. A Comparator is a separate class that\nimplements the comparison logic. This approach allows you to have\nmultiple ways of sorting objects without modifying their original\nclass.\nFor instance, let's say you want to sort instances of the Person class\nnot only by age but also by name. You can create a separate\nNameComparator class that implements the Comparator<Person>\ninterface:\nimport java.util.Comparator;\npublic class NameComparator implements Comparator<Person> {\n@Override\npublic int compare(Person person1, Person person2) {\nreturn person1.getName().compareTo(person2.getName());\n}\n}\nThen, you can sort instances of Person using this NameComparator:\nList<Person> people = new ArrayList<>();\n// Add people to the list\nCollections.sort(people, new NameComparator());\nIn summary, the key differences between Comparable and\nComparator in Java are:\n- Comparable is used to define the natural ordering within a class\nitself.\n- Comparator is used to define external comparison logic for classes\nthat may not have a natural ordering or when you want to sort\nbased on different criteria.

    "question": "What is the hierarchy of exceptions?",
    "answer": "In Java, exceptions are organized in a hierarchical manner, with the\njava.lang.Throwable class at the root of the hierarchy. The\nThrowable class has two direct subclasses: Error and Exception. The\nError class represents unrecoverable errors that usually occur at the\nsystem level, such as OutOfMemoryError. The Exception class\nrepresents recoverable errors and has several subclasses, such as\nRuntimeException and IOException.\nHere's a hierarchy of some of the most common exception classes in\nJava:\nThrowable\n├── Error\n│ ├── AssertionError\n│ ├── OutOfMemoryError\n│ └── StackOverflowError\n└── Exception\n├── RuntimeException\n│ ├── NullPointerException\n│ ├── IndexOutOfBoundsException\n│ ├── IllegalArgumentException\n│ ├── IllegalStateException\n│ └── ArithmeticException\n└── Checked Exceptions\n├── IOException\n├── SQLException\n└── ClassNotFoundException\nAs shown in the hierarchy above, RuntimeException and its\nsubclasses represent unchecked exceptions that do not need to be\ndeclared in a method's throws clause. All other exceptions are\nchecked exceptions, which must be declared in a method's throws\nclause or handled within the method using a try-catch block.\nIt is important to note that Java allows the creation of custom\nexception classes by extending the Exception class or one of its\nsubclasses. By doing so, developers can create their own custom\nexceptions that represent specific errors or situations in their\napplication.\nExplain Throw, Throws, and Throwable keywords in java.\nIn Java, the keywords \"throw\", \"throws\", and \"Throwable\" are used\nto handle and manage exceptions in a program:\nThe \"throw\" keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception. When\na method encounters an exceptional situation and it cannot handle\nit, it can throw an exception to the calling method. This allows the\ncalling method to handle the exception in an appropriate way. The\ngeneral form of the throw statement is \"throw exception_object;\",\nwhere exception_object is an instance of a class that extends the\nThrowable class.\npublic void method() throws Exception {\nif (condition) {\nthrow new Exception(\"Exception occurred\");\n}\n}\nThe \"throws\" keyword is used in the method signature to indicate\nthat a method can throw one or more exceptions. The general form\nof the throws clause is \"throws exception_class, exception_class,...\",\nwhere exception_class is the type of exception that the method can\nthrow. It's important to notice that when a method throws an\nexception, it's not handling it, it's just indicating that it can happen.\npublic void method() throws Exception {\n// code\n}\nThe \"Throwable\" class is the parent class of all exceptions and errors\nin Java. It is the superclass of all classes that can be thrown by the\nJava Virtual Machine (JVM) or the user. The Throwable class defines\nseveral methods that can be used to print the stack trace of an\nexception, get the message of an exception, and get the cause of an\nexception.\nIn summary, \"throw\" keyword is used to throw an exception,\n\"throws\" keyword is used to indicate that a method can throw an\nexception and \"Throwable\" is the base class for all the exception and\nerrors in Java.",

It\nis one of the most commonly used classes in Java and is included in\nthe java.lang package, which means that it is automatically imported\ninto every Java program.\nA String object can be created using a string literal or by using the\nnew keyword and a constructor. For example:\nString str1 = \"Hello, world!\";\nString str2 = new String(\"Hello, world!\");\nBoth of these statements create a String object that contains the\nsequence of characters \"Hello, world!\".\nOnce a String object is created, its value cannot be changed. In\nother words, String is an immutable class. Therefore, any operation\non a String object creates a new String object.\nThe String class provides many useful methods for manipulating\nstrings, such as charAt(), indexOf(), substring(), toUpperCase(),\ntoLowerCase(), trim(), length(), and many others.\nString objects are also widely used in Java as parameters to method\ncalls, in concatenation operations, and as return values from\nmethods.\nIn summary, String is a class in Java that represents a sequence of\ncharacters and is widely used for string manipulation and processing.",

    "question": "Why String is immutable?",
    "answer": "Here are the key reasons why String is immutable in Java and other\nlanguages:\n1. Security:\nStrings are often used to store sensitive information like passwords,\nURLs, and database connection strings. Immutability makes them\ntamper-proof, preventing accidental or malicious modification of\nsensitive data. This enhances security and reduces the risk of\nvulnerabilities.\n2. Caching and Performance:\nJava caches String literals in a String pool for efficient reuse. If\nStrings were mutable, changes to one String could affect other\nStrings using the same literal, leading to unpredictable behavior.\nImmutability ensures that String values remain consistent and\npredictable, even when shared across multiple references.\n3. Synchronization and Thread Safety:\nImmutable objects are inherently thread-safe, as their state cannot\nbe modified by multiple threads concurrently. This eliminates the\nneed for synchronization mechanisms (like locks) when working with\nStrings in multithreaded environments, simplifying code and\nimproving performance.\n4. Class Loading:\nJava uses String objects for class names and resource paths.\nImmutability ensures that these references remain stable and\nreliable throughout the application's lifecycle, preventing issues with\nclass loading and resource access.\n5. Use as Keys in Hash-Based Data Structures:\nStrings are commonly used as keys in hash-based data structures\nlike HashMap and HashSet. Immutability guarantees that the\nhashcode of a String remains consistent throughout its lifetime,\nmaking these data structures work correctly and efficiently.\n6. Substring Operations:\nWhile String objects themselves are immutable, Java provides\nmethods to create new String objects that are modified versions of\nexisting ones. For example, the substring() method returns a new\nString that is a portion of the original String, without altering the\noriginal object.\n7. StringBuilder and StringBuffer:\nFor scenarios where you need to modify String content frequently,\nJava offers mutable alternatives: StringBuilder (for non-thread-safe\noperations) and StringBuffer (for thread-safe operations). These\nclasses are designed for efficient String manipulation and\nmodification.",

    "question": "Where is a new string is stored?",
    "answer": "The storage location of a new String depends on how it's created:\n1. String Literal Pool:\nWhen you create a String using a literal (e.g., String str = \"Hello\";),\nJava checks the String pool first.\nIf an identical String already exists in the pool, it reuses that object\nfor efficiency.\nThis means multiple variables can refer to the same String object in\nmemory, saving space.\n2. Heap Memory:\nIf the String literal doesn't exist in the pool, a new String object is\ncreated and stored in the heap memory.\nThis happens in two main cases:\nWhen you create a String using the new keyword: String str = new\nString(\"Hello\");\nWhen you modify an existing String, resulting in a new String object:\nString str2 = str.concat(\" World\");\n3. String Interning:\nYou can explicitly place a String in the pool using the intern()\nmethod: String internedStr = \"Hello\".intern();\nThis ensures that all String variables with the same content refer to\nthe same object in the pool, even if they were created with new.",

The stack is\na region of memory that is used to store local variables and method\nparameters. When you assign a string object to a variable, the JVM\nstores the reference to the object in the stack memory.\nHere is an example of how strings are stored in memory:\nString myString = \"Hello, world!\";\nIn this example, the string object \"Hello, world!\" is stored in the\nheap memory.

However,\nit is possible to create a similar custom class that is immutable.\nTo create a custom immutable string class, you can follow these\nsteps:\nDefine a private final field of type String to store the string value.\nCreate a constructor that accepts a String parameter and initializes\nthe private field.\nDo not provide any setter methods that can modify the value of the\nprivate field.\nOverride the toString() method to return the value of the private\nfield.\nIf necessary, override the equals() and hashCode() methods to\nensure that objects of this class can be properly compared and used\nas keys in hash-based collections.\nHere's an example implementation of a custom immutable string\nclass:\npublic final class ImmutableString {\nprivate final String value;\npublic ImmutableString(String value) {\nthis.value = value;\n}\npublic String toString() {\nreturn value;\n}\npublic boolean equals(Object obj) {\nif (this == obj) {\nreturn true;\n}\nif (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) {\nreturn false;\n}\nImmutableString other = (ImmutableString) obj;\nreturn Objects.equals(value, other.value);\n}\npublic int hashCode() {\nreturn Objects.hash(value);\n}\n}\nIn this implementation, the value field is declared as final, which\nmakes it immutable.

Therefore, any operation on\na String object creates a new object. For example, if two String\nobjects are concatenated using the + operator, a new String object\nis created. This can be inefficient if many string manipulations are\nneeded, as it creates a lot of temporary objects.\nStringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable classes that can be used\nto perform string manipulation operations efficiently. StringBuffer\nwas introduced in Java 1.0, while StringBuilder was added in Java\n1.5. Both classes provide methods for appending, inserting, deleting,\nand replacing characters in a string.\nThe main difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder is that\nStringBuffer is thread-safe, which means that multiple threads can\nsafely access and modify the same StringBuffer object at the same\ntime without any issues. On the other hand, StringBuilder is not\nthread-safe, and therefore should be used in single-threaded\nenvironments.\nIn summary:\nString is immutable, so any operation on a String object creates a\nnew object.\nStringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable and provide methods for\nefficient string manipulation.\nStringBuffer is thread-safe, while StringBuilder is not.\nTherefore, String is best used for situations where the string value\nwill not change frequently, while StringBuffer or StringBuilder should\nbe used for situations where frequent string manipulations are\nrequired.

This can lead to\nperformance problems if it is called repeatedly in a loop or in\nperformance-critical code. To avoid this, you can use the\nStringBuilder or StringBuffer classes to build a string gradually\ninstead of using substring().\nAnother potential issue with substring() is that it can throw an\nIndexOutOfBoundsException if the starting index or ending index is\nout of bounds. To avoid this, you should always check the length of\nthe string before calling substring() and ensure that the indices are\nwithin the valid range.\nIt's also important to note that the substring() method returns a new\nstring object that shares the same character array as the original\nstring object. This means that if you modify the substring, it will also\nmodify the original string.

Instead, they are thrown implicitly by the JVM\nwhen an error condition occurs at runtime.\nRuntime exceptions are implemented as subclasses of the\nRuntimeException class, which itself is a subclass of the Exception\nclass. Some examples of runtime exception classes in Java include\nNullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, and\nArithmeticException.\nRuntime exceptions can be caused by a variety of factors, such as\ninvalid input, incorrect usage of APIs, or unexpected conditions such\nas a divide-by-zero error. When a runtime exception occurs, the JVM\nwill throw an instance of the corresponding exception class, which\ncan then be caught and handled by the program if necessary.\nTo catch runtime exceptions in a Java program, you can use a try-\ncatch block. For example:\ntry {\n// code that may throw a runtime exception\n} catch (NullPointerException e) {\n// handle the null pointer exception\n} catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {\n// handle the array index out of bounds exception\n} catch (Exception e) {\n// handle any other exception\n}\nIt's important to note that while runtime exceptions do not need to\nbe declared in the method signature, they should still be handled\nproperly in the program to avoid unexpected termination or other\nissues.",

It uses a\nhash table to store the elements, which allows for constant-time\nperformance for basic operations such as add, remove, and contains.\nHowever, because the elements are not ordered, the order in which\nthey are stored is not guaranteed.\nHere is an example of how to create a HashSet and add elements to\nit:\nSet<String> set = new HashSet<>();\nset.add(\"apple\");\nset.add(\"banana\");\nset.add(\"orange\");\nA TreeSet, on the other hand, is an ordered collection of unique\nelements. It is implemented as a self-balancing binary search tree,\nwhich allows for log(n) performance for basic operations such as\nadd, remove, and contains. Because the elements are ordered, the\norder in which they are stored is guaranteed according to their\nnatural ordering or a custom comparator.\nHere is an example of how to create a TreeSet and add elements to\nit:\nSet<String> set = new TreeSet<>();\nset.add(\"apple\");\nset.add(\"banana\");\nset.add(\"orange\");\nIn general, you should choose a HashSet when you don't care about\nthe order of the elements and need fast performance for basic\noperations, and a TreeSet when you need to maintain a specific\nordering of the elements or perform range queries over the\nelements.",

This is achieved by dividing\nthe map into multiple segments, each of which is protected by a\nseparate lock. This allows multiple threads to read and write to\ndifferent segments of the map simultaneously, improving the\nperformance of concurrent operations.\nConcurrentHashmap provides the same basic operations as a regular\nHashMap, such as put(), get(), remove(), and containsKey(). It also\nprovides additional atomic operations, such as putIfAbsent(),\nremove(), and replace(), which can be used to perform atomic\nupdates to the map.\nConcurrentHashMap is particularly useful in applications where\nmultiple threads need to access a shared map concurrently, such as\nin web servers, database systems, and other multi-threaded\napplications.\nHere's an example of how to use ConcurrentHashMap:\nConcurrentHashMap<String, Integer> map = new\nConcurrentHashMap<>();\n// Add elements to the map\nmap.put(\"one\", 1);\nmap.put(\"two\", 2);\nmap.put(\"three\", 3);\n// Retrieve elements from the map\nSystem.out.println(map.get(\"one\")); // prints 1\n// Remove an element from the map\nmap.remove(\"two\");\n// Check if a key exists in the map\nSystem.out.println(map.containsKey(\"two\")); // prints false\nIn this example, we create a ConcurrentHashMap and add three\nelements to it. We then retrieve an element by key, remove an\nelement by key, and check if a key exists in the map.\nNote that ConcurrentHashMap does not provide any guarantees\nabout the order in which elements are inserted or accessed, so if\nyou need to maintain ordering, you should use a different type of\nmap, such as LinkedHashMap.",

The process of serialization is commonly used in Java\nfor data persistence, inter-process communication, and distributed\ncomputing.\nTo make an object serializable, it must implement the Serializable\ninterface, which is a marker interface that indicates to the Java\nVirtual Machine (JVM) that the object can be serialized. When an\nobject is serialized, all of its instance variables and non-transient\nfields are written to a stream of bytes, along with information about\nthe object's class and superclasses.\nJava provides two main mechanisms for serializing and deserializing\nobjects: ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream.\nObjectOutputStream is used to write the serialized object to an\noutput stream, while ObjectInputStream is used to read the\nserialized object from an input stream.\nHere's an example of how to serialize an object in Java:\nimport java.io.*;\npublic class SerializationDemo {\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\ntry {\n// create an object to be serialized\nPerson person = new Person(\"John\", 25);\n// serialize the object to a file\nFileOutputStream fileOut = new\nFileOutputStream(\"person.ser\");\nObjectOutputStream out = new\nObjectOutputStream(fileOut);\nout.writeObject(person);\nout.close();\nfileOut.close();\nSystem.out.println(\"Serialized data is saved in person.ser\");\n} catch (IOException e) {\ne.printStackTrace();\n}\n}\n}\nclass Person implements Serializable {\nprivate String name;\nprivate int age;\npublic Person(String name, int age) {\nthis.name = name;\nthis.age = age;\n}\npublic String getName() {\nreturn name;\n}\npublic int getAge() {\nreturn age;\n}\n}\nIn this example, we create a Person object and serialize it to a file\nnamed person.ser. The Person class implements the Serializable\ninterface, which allows it to be serialized using ObjectOutputStream.\nOnce the object is serialized, it can be deserialized and reconstructed\nlater using ObjectInputStream.\nSerialization is a powerful tool in Java, but it also has some\nlimitations and potential drawbacks. Serialized objects can take up a\nlot of disk space or network bandwidth, and they may not be\ncompatible with different versions of the same class.

By serializing and deserializing objects, we can save the\nobject state to a file or database and then reload it later as needed.\nCopying Objects: In some cases, it may be useful to create a copy of\nan object.

A thread is an\nindependent path of execution within a program that can run\nconcurrently with other threads.\nIn a single-threaded program, the program executes instructions in a\nlinear fashion, with each instruction completing before the next one\nbegins. In a multithreaded program, multiple threads can run\nconcurrently, with each thread executing a different part of the\nprogram at the same time.\nMultithreading is used to achieve concurrency in a program, which\ncan lead to improved performance and responsiveness. For example,\na multithreaded program can allow one thread to handle user input\nand another thread to perform a long-running task in the\nbackground, without blocking the user interface.\nHowever, multithreading also introduces new challenges, such as\nthread synchronization and race conditions. Proper synchronization\nmechanisms need to be implemented to ensure that threads can\naccess shared resources safely and prevent data corruption or\nunexpected program behaviour.\nMultithreading is widely used in modern software development,\nparticularly in applications that require high performance or\nresponsiveness, such as web servers, video games, and scientific\nsimulations.",

    "answer": "In Java, a thread pool is a collection of pre-initialized threads that\nare used to execute a set of tasks. Thread pools are used to\noptimize the performance of concurrent programs by reducing the\noverhead of creating and destroying threads.\nThe main advantage of using a thread pool is that it allows multiple\ntasks to be executed concurrently by reusing threads from a pool,\nrather than creating a new thread for each task. This reduces the\noverhead of creating and destroying threads, which can be\nexpensive in terms of memory and CPU usage.\nThe Java concurrency API provides a built-in thread pool\nimplementation called ExecutorService. ExecutorService is an\ninterface that provides methods to submit tasks to a thread pool and\nmanage its lifecycle. The Executors class provides utility methods for\ncreating different types of ExecutorService implementations, such as\na fixed thread pool, cached thread pool, or scheduled thread pool.\nHere is an example of how to create and use a thread pool in Java:\nExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);\nfor (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\nRunnable task = new Task(i);\nexecutor.submit(task);\n}\nexecutor.shutdown();\nIn this example, a fixed thread pool with a maximum of 5 threads is\ncreated using the newFixedThreadPool method of the Executors\nclass. Ten tasks are then submitted to the thread pool using the\nsubmit method of the ExecutorService interface.

    "answer": "Thread dump analysis is the process of examining the state of\nthreads in a Java program to identify and diagnose issues such as\ndeadlocks, high CPU usage, or performance bottlenecks. Here are\nthe steps to perform a thread dump analysis in Java:\nTake a thread dump: A thread dump is a snapshot of the state of all\nthreads in a Java program. To take a thread dump, you can use the\njstack command-line tool or a Java profiler such as VisualVM or\nYourKit. For example, to take a thread dump using jstack, you can\nrun the following command:\njstack <pid>\nWhere <pid> is the process ID of the Java program.\nAnalyze the thread dump: Once you have a thread dump, you can\nanalyze it to identify potential issues such as deadlocks or high CPU\nusage. Look for threads that are blocked or waiting, as these can\nindicate potential issues. Pay attention to the stack traces of each\nthread, as they can provide valuable information about what the\nthread is doing and what resources it is waiting for.\nIdentify the root cause: Based on the information gathered from the\nthread dump analysis, you can identify the root cause of the issue\nand take appropriate action to address it. For example, if you\nidentify a deadlock, you may need to modify the code to avoid\nacquiring locks in a circular order or use a timeout on locks to avoid\nindefinite blocking.\nIn addition to thread dumps, there are other tools and techniques\navailable for thread analysis in Java, such as profiling tools like\nVisualVM, JProfiler, or YourKit, or logging frameworks like log4j or\nSLF4J.

    "question": "What is deadlock I multithreading?",
    "answer": "Deadlock in Java is a situation that occurs when two or more threads\nare blocked and waiting for each other to release the resources they\nhold. As a result, none of the threads can proceed with their\nexecution, leading to a complete halt in the program.\nA typical scenario for a deadlock involves two or more threads\nacquiring locks on multiple resources in different orders. For\nexample, Thread A may acquire a lock on Resource X, while Thread\nB acquires a lock on Resource Y. If Thread A then attempts to\nacquire a lock on Resource Y while Thread B attempts to acquire a\nlock on Resource X, both threads will be blocked, waiting for the\nother thread to release the lock. This situation is known as a\ndeadlock.\nDeadlocks can be difficult to detect and diagnose, as they typically\ndo not result in any error messages or exceptions. They can lead to\nsignificant performance degradation or even complete program\nfailure if not properly handled.\nTo prevent deadlocks, it's important to follow best practices for\nconcurrent programming, such as avoiding nested locks, acquiring\nlocks in a consistent order, and using timeouts on locks to avoid\nindefinite blocking.

A thread dump is a\nsnapshot of the current state of all threads in a Java program. You\ncan use the jstack command-line tool or a Java profiler to capture a\nthread dump and analyze it to check for deadlocks.\nTo prevent deadlocks in a Java program, you can use several\ntechniques, including:\nAcquire locks in a consistent order: One of the main causes of\ndeadlocks is when multiple threads acquire locks on resources in\ndifferent orders. To prevent this, you can define a consistent order\nfor acquiring locks and ensure that all threads follow the same order.\nUse timeouts on lock acquisition: To prevent deadlocks caused by\nthread contention for a lock, you can use timeouts on lock\nacquisition. This allows threads to wait for a lock for a limited time,\nafter which they release the lock and try again later.\nAvoid nested locks: Nested locks, where a thread acquires one lock\nwhile holding another lock, can increase the likelihood of deadlocks.\nTo prevent this, you can try to design your code to avoid nested\nlocks wherever possible.\nUse higher-level concurrency abstractions: Higher-level concurrency\nabstractions, such as semaphores, barriers, or thread-safe data\nstructures, can help to simplify the management of concurrent code\nand reduce the likelihood of deadlocks.\nTest and debug your code: Testing and debugging your code using\ntools such as jUnit, JMeter, or debuggers can help you identify and\nfix potential issues before they cause deadlocks in production.\nBy using these techniques, you can prevent deadlocks and ensure\nthe reliability and performance of your Java program.",

    "question": "What is Method Reference in Java 8?",
    "answer": "In Java 8, a method reference is a shorthand notation for a lambda\nexpression that simply invokes an existing method. The basic syntax\nfor a method reference is:\nClassName::methodName\nFor example, if you have a class called \"MyClass\" with a method\ncalled \"myMethod\", you could use a method reference to invoke that\nmethod like this:\nMyClass::myMethod\nYou can also use method references with constructors and array\nconstructors. The basic syntax for a constructor reference is:\nClassName::new\nFor example, if you have a class called \"MyClass\", you could use a\nconstructor reference to create a new instance of that class like this:\nMyClass::new\nAnd the basic syntax for a array constructor reference is:\nTypeName[]::new\nFor example, if you want to create an array of integers, you could\nuse an array constructor reference like this:\nint[]::new\nMethod references can be used in situations where a lambda\nexpression would be used to invoke an existing method, such as\nwhen passing a method as an argument to a higher-order function.",

    "answer": "In Java 8, the Stream API is used to process collections of data in a\nfunctional manner. The Stream API provides two types of operations:\nintermediate and terminal.\nIntermediate operations are operations that are performed on a\nstream, but do not produce a final result. They are used to transform\nthe elements of a stream in some way, and return a new stream that\ncontains the transformed elements. Examples of intermediate\noperations include filter, map, and flatMap.\nTerminal operations are operations that produce a final result or a\nside-effect. They are used to consume the elements of a stream and\nproduce a final result, such as a count, a sum, or a list. Examples of\nterminal operations include forEach, reduce, and collect.\nIntermediate operations are lazy, meaning that they are not\nexecuted until a terminal operation is called. This allows multiple\nintermediate operations to be chained together, with the result of\none operation being passed as the input to the next.\nFor example,\nList<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\nint sum = numbers.stream()\n.filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)\n.map(n -> n * 2)\n.reduce(0, Integer::sum);\nIn this example, filter is an intermediate operation that filters the\nstream of numbers to keep only even numbers. map is an\nintermediate operation that transforms each number in the stream\nby doubling it. reduce is a terminal operation that sums the numbers\nin the stream and returns the result.\nIt is important to note that once a terminal operation is called, the\nstream is considered consumed and it can't be reused.",

    "answer": "Parallel processing in Java 8 refers to the ability to perform\noperations on a stream in parallel, using multiple threads. The Java 8\nStream API provides the parallel() method, which can be used to\ncreate a parallel stream from an existing sequential stream.\nA parallel stream automatically splits the data into smaller chunks\nand assigns each chunk to a separate thread for processing. The\nresults from each thread are then combined to produce the final\nresult.\nParallel processing can be useful for improving the performance of\ncertain types of operations, such as filtering and mapping, on large\ndata sets. It can also be used to perform complex computations in\nparallel, such as reducing a large data set to a single value.\nFor example,\nList<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);\nint sum =\nnumbers.parallelStream().mapToInt(Integer::intValue).sum();\nIn this example, the parallelStream() method is used to create a\nparallel stream of the numbers, and the mapToInt() and sum()\nmethods are used to calculate the sum of the numbers in parallel.\nIt's important to note that parallel processing may not always be\nbeneficial and it is dependent on the size of data and nature of\noperation.

    "answer": "A default method is a method defined in an interface that has a\ndefault implementation. Default methods were introduced in Java 8\nto allow interfaces to be extended without breaking existing\nimplementations.\nPrior to Java 8, interfaces could only contain method signatures,\nwhich meant that any class that implemented an interface was\nrequired to provide an implementation for all of its methods. This\ncould be problematic when you wanted to add new methods to an\nexisting interface, because it would break all of the existing\nimplementations.\nWith default methods, you can provide a default implementation for\na method in an interface, which means that classes that implement\nthe interface are not required to provide their own implementation.\nIf a class does not provide its own implementation for a default\nmethod, it will use the default implementation defined in the\ninterface.\nDefault methods are useful for extending existing interfaces without\nbreaking existing implementations. They can also be used to provide\na common implementation for a method that is applicable to all\nclasses that implement the interface.\nFor example, consider an interface for a collection of items:\npublic interface Collection<T> {\nvoid add(T item);\nboolean contains(T item);\nint size();\ndefault boolean isEmpty() {\nreturn size() == 0;\n}\n}\nThis interface defines three methods for adding items to the\ncollection, checking if an item is contained in the collection, and\ngetting the size of the collection. It also defines a default method,\nisEmpty(), that returns true if the size of the collection is 0.\nClasses that implement this interface are not required to provide\ntheir own implementation for isEmpty(), because a default\nimplementation is already provided in the interface.

Static methods can be called without creating an\ninstance of the interface.\npublic interface Animal {\nstatic void makeSound() {\nSystem.out.println(\"I am making a sound.\");\n}\n}\nThe makeSound() method can be called without creating an instance\nof the Animal interface:\nAnimal.makeSound(); // prints \"I am making a sound.\"\nDefault and static methods can be used to improve the design of\nJava applications in a number of ways.

Metaspace is part of the native memory heap,\nwhich means that it is not limited by the maximum heap size.\nG1 garbage collector: Java 8 introduced the G1 garbage collector as\nthe default garbage collector.

This helps to prevent concurrency problems and makes\nJava code more robust.\nHere is an example of how to use a lambda function without causing\na concurrency problem:\nint x = 0;\nRunnable runnable = () -> {\n// This is safe because the variable x is final.\nint y = x + 1;\nSystem.out.println(y);\n};\nThread thread1 = new Thread(runnable);\nThread thread2 = new Thread(runnable);\nthread1.start();\nthread2.start();\nIn this example, the x variable is final, so it cannot be modified by\nmultiple threads at the same time.

DI is a design pattern that allows\na class to have its dependencies provided to it, rather than creating\nthem itself.\nSpring provides several ways to inject beans into other beans,\nincluding:\nConstructor injection: A bean can be injected into another bean by\npassing it as a constructor argument. Spring will automatically create\nan instance of the dependent bean and pass it to the constructor.\npublic class BeanA {\nprivate final BeanB beanB;\npublic BeanA(BeanB beanB) {\nthis.beanB = beanB;\n}\n}\nSetter injection: A bean can be injected into another bean by\npassing it as a setter method argument. Spring will automatically call\nthe setter method and pass the dependent bean.\npublic class BeanA {\nprivate BeanB beanB;\n@Autowired\npublic void setBeanB(BeanB beanB) {\nthis.beanB = beanB;\n}\n}\nField injection: A bean can be injected into another bean by\nannotating a field with the @Autowired annotation. Spring will\nautomatically set the field with the dependent bean.\npublic class BeanA {\n@Autowired\nprivate BeanB beanB;\n}\nInterface injection: A bean can be injected into another bean by\nimplementing an interface. Spring will automatically set the field with\nthe dependent bean.\npublic class BeanA implements BeanBUser {\n@Autowired\nprivate BeanB beanB;\n}\nIt's important to note that, you can use any combination of the\nabove methods, but you should choose the appropriate one\ndepending on your use case.\nAlso, Spring uses a technique called Autowiring to automatically wire\nbeans together, Autowiring can be done by type, by name, or by\nconstructor.\nBy default, Spring will try to autowire beans by type, but if there are\nmultiple beans of the same type, it will try to autowire by name\nusing the bean's name defined in the configuration file.",

    "question": "How does the spring container handle eager\n& lazy loading?",
    "answer": "A cyclic dependency between beans occurs when two or more beans\nhave a mutual dependency on each other, which can cause issues\nwith the creation and initialization of these beans.\nThere are several ways to handle cyclic dependencies between\nbeans in Spring:\nLazy Initialization: By using the @Lazy annotation on one of the\nbeans involved in the cycle, it can be initialized only when it is\nactually needed.\n@Lazy\n@Autowired\nprivate BeanA beanA;\nConstructor injection: Instead of using setter or field injection, you\ncan use constructor injection, which will make sure that the\ndependencies are provided before the bean is fully initialized.\npublic class BeanA {\nprivate final BeanB beanB;\npublic BeanA(BeanB beanB) {\nthis.beanB = beanB;\n}\n}\nUse a proxy: A proxy can be used to break the cycle by delaying the\ninitialization of one of the beans until it is actually needed. Spring\nAOP can be used to create a proxy for one of the beans involved in\nthe cycle.\nUse BeanFactory: Instead of injecting the bean directly, you can use\nBeanFactory to retrieve the bean when it's actually needed.\npublic class BeanA {\nprivate BeanB beanB;\n@Autowired\npublic BeanA(BeanFactory beanFactory) {\nthis.beanB = beanFactory.getBean(BeanB.class);\n}\n}\nIt's important to note that, the best way to handle cyclic\ndependencies will depend on the specific requirements of your\napplication.

    "question": "How does filter work in spring?",
    "answer": "In Spring Framework, a filter is a component that can be used to\npre-process and post-process requests and responses in a web\napplication. Filters are executed before and after the request is\nhandled by the controller. They can be used for various purposes\nsuch as:\nLogging and auditing\nAuthentication and Authorization\nEncoding and Decoding\nCompression\nCaching\nA filter in Spring can be implemented as a class that implements the\njavax.servlet.Filter interface. This interface defines three methods:\ninit(FilterConfig), doFilter(ServletRequest, ServletResponse,\nFilterChain), and destroy(). The init() method is called when the\nfilter is first initialized, the doFilter() method is called for each\nrequest, and the destroy() method is called when the filter is being\ntaken out of service.\nTo use a filter in a Spring application, you can register the filter using\nFilterRegistrationBean or @WebFilter annotation. Once a filter is\nregistered, it can be mapped to a specific URL pattern or servlet.\nThe doFilter() method of a filter is where the actual processing takes\nplace. The method is passed a ServletRequest, a ServletResponse,\nand a FilterChain object. The FilterChain object represents the chain\nof filters that are executed for a particular request. The doFilter()\nmethod can choose to pass the request and response to the next\nfilter in the chain by calling the doFilter() method on the FilterChain\nobject, or it can choose to handle the request itself and not pass the\nrequest and response to the next filter.\nIn summary, filters are a powerful way to add pre-processing and\npost-processing to requests and responses in a Spring web\napplication. They can be used for various purposes such as logging,\nauthentication, encoding, compression, and caching. A filter is a\nclass that implements the javax.servlet.Filter interface, it can be\nregistered using FilterRegistrationBean or @WebFilter annotation,\nand it can be mapped to a specific URL pattern or servlet.",

    "question": "Can singleton bean scope handle multiple parallel requests?",
    "answer": "A singleton bean in Spring has a single instance that is shared across\nall requests, regardless of the number of parallel requests. This\nmeans that if two requests are processed simultaneously, they will\nshare the same bean instance and access to the bean's state will be\nshared among the requests.\nHowever, it's important to note that if the singleton bean is stateful,\nand the state is shared among requests, this could lead to race\nconditions and other concurrency issues. For example, if two\nrequests are trying to modify the same piece of data at the same\ntime, it could lead to data inconsistencies.\nTo avoid these issues, it's important to make sure that any stateful\nsingleton beans are designed to be thread-safe. One way to do this\nis to use synchronization or other concurrency control mechanisms\nsuch as the synchronized keyword, Lock or ReentrantLock classes, or\nthe @Transactional annotation if the bean is performing database\noperations.\nOn the other hand, if the singleton bean is stateless, it can handle\nmultiple parallel requests without any issues. It can be used to\nprovide shared functionality that doesn't depend on the state of the\nbean.\nIn conclusion, a singleton bean can handle multiple parallel requests,\nbut it's important to be aware of the state of the bean and to ensure\nthat it's designed to be thread-safe if it has shared state.\nTell me the Design pattern used inside the spring framework.\nThe Spring Framework makes use of several design patterns to\nprovide its functionality. Some of the key design patterns used in\nSpring are:\nInversion of Control (IoC): This pattern is used throughout the\nSpring Framework to decouple the application code from the\nframework and its components. The IoC container is responsible for\nmanaging the lifecycle of beans and injecting dependencies between\nthem.\nSingleton: A singleton pattern is used to ensure that there is only\none instance of a bean created in the Spring IoC container. The\nsingleton pattern is used to create a single instance of a class, which\nis shared across the entire application.\nFactory: The factory pattern is used in Spring to create objects of\ndifferent classes based on the configuration. Spring provides a\nfactory pattern to create beans, which is based on the factory\nmethod design pattern.\nTemplate Method: The template method pattern is used in Spring to\nprovide a common structure for different types of operations. Spring\nprovides several template classes such as JdbcTemplate, Hibernate\nTemplate, etc. that provide a common structure for performing\ndatabase operations.\nDecorator: The decorator pattern is used in Spring to add additional\nfunctionality to existing beans. The Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented\nProgramming) module uses the decorator pattern to add additional\nfunctionality to existing beans through the use of proxies.\nObserver: The observer pattern is used in Spring to notify other\nbeans of changes to the state of a bean. Spring provides the\nApplicationEvent and ApplicationListener interfaces, which can be\nused to implement the observer pattern.\nCommand: The command pattern is used in Spring to encapsulate\nthe execution of a particular piece of code in a command object.\nThis pattern is used in Spring to create reusable and testable code.\nFaçade: The façade pattern is used in Spring to simplify the interface\nof a complex system. The Spring Framework uses the façade pattern\nto provide a simplified interface for interacting with its components.\nThese are just a few examples of the design patterns used in Spring,\nthere are many more. Spring framework makes use of these\npatterns to provide a consistent and simple way to build\napplications, making it easier to manage complex systems.",

    "question": "How do factory design patterns work in terms of the spring\nframework?",
    "answer": "In Spring, the factory design pattern is used to create objects of\ndifferent classes based on the configuration. The Spring IoC\ncontainer uses the factory pattern to create beans, which is based\non the factory method design pattern.\nThe factory method is a design pattern that provides a way to create\nobjects of different classes based on a factory interface. In Spring,\nthe IoC container acts as the factory, and the factory interface is\nrepresented by the BeanFactory or ApplicationContext interfaces.\nThe IoC container is responsible for creating and managing the\nlifecycle of beans. When you define a bean in the configuration, the\nIoC container will use the factory pattern to create an instance of\nthe bean. The IoC container will then manage the lifecycle of the\nbean, including injecting dependencies, initializing the bean, and\ndestroying the bean when it is no longer needed.\nHere's an example of how you can define a bean in Spring using the\nfactory design pattern:\n@Configuration\npublic class MyConfig {\n@Bean\npublic MyService myService() {\nreturn new MyService();\n}\n}\nIn this example, the myService() method is annotated with @Bean.\nThis tells Spring to create an instance of the MyService class when\nthe IoC container is created. The IoC container will use the factory\npattern to create the instance and manage its lifecycle.\nAnother way to use factory pattern in spring is to use FactoryBean\ninterface, which allows you to create beans that are created by a\nfactory method, it's a factory of bean. The FactoryBean interface\ndefines a single method, getObject(), which returns the object that\nshould be exposed as the bean in the Spring application context.\nIn summary, the factory design pattern is used in the Spring\nFramework to create objects of different classes based on the\nconfiguration. The Spring IoC container acts as the factory, and the\nfactory interface is represented by the BeanFactory or\nApplicationContext interfaces, creating and managing the lifecycle of\nbeans, and also can be used by implementing FactoryBean interface\nto create beans in a factory method.",

    "question": "How the proxy design pattern is used in spring?",
    "answer": "The proxy design pattern is used in Spring to add additional\nfunctionality to existing objects. The Spring Framework uses the\nproxy pattern to provide AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)\nfunctionality, which allows you to add cross-cutting concerns, such\nas logging, security, and transaction management, to your\napplication in a modular and reusable way.\nIn Spring, AOP proxies are created by the IoC container, and they\nare used to intercept method calls made to the target bean. This\nallows you to add additional behaviour, such as logging or security\nchecks, before or after the method call is made to the target bean.\nAOP proxies are created using one of three proxy types: JDK\ndynamic proxies, CGLIB proxies, or AspectJ proxies.\nJDK dynamic proxies: This is the default proxy type in Spring, and it\nis used to proxy interfaces.\nCGLIB proxies: This proxy type is used to proxy classes, and it works\nby creating a subclass of the target bean.\nAspectJ proxies: This proxy type uses the AspectJ library to create\nproxies, and it allows you to use AspectJ pointcuts and advice in\nyour application.\nSpring uses the proxy pattern to provide AOP functionality by\ngenerating a proxy object that wraps the target bean. The proxy\nobject will intercept method calls made to the target bean, and it will\ninvoke additional behavior, such as logging or security checks, before\nor after the method call is made to the target bean.\nHere's an example of how you can use Spring AOP to add logging to\na bean:\n@Aspect\n@Component\npublic class LoggingAspect {\n@Before(\"execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))\")\npublic void logBefore(JoinPoint joinPoint) {\nlog.info(\"Started method: \" +\njoinPoint.getSignature().getName());\n}\n}\nIn this example, the LoggingAspect class is annotated with @Aspect\nand @Component to make it a Spring bean. The @Before annotation\nis used to specify that the logBefore() method should be executed\nbefore the method call is made to the target bean. The logBefore()\nmethod uses the JoinPoint argument to log the name of the method\nthat is being called.\nIn summary, the proxy design pattern is used in Spring to add\nadditional functionality to existing objects by intercepting method\ncalls made to the target bean and invoke additional behavior before\nor after the method call using AOP functionality.

    "question": "What if we call singleton bean from prototype or prototype\nbean from singleton How many objects returned?",
    "answer": "When a singleton bean is called from a prototype bean or vice versa,\nthe behavior depends on how the dependency is injected.\nIf a singleton bean is injected into a prototype bean, then each time\nthe prototype bean is created, it will receive the same instance of\nthe singleton bean. This is because the singleton bean is only\ncreated once during the startup of the application context, and that\nsame instance is then injected into the prototype bean each time it\nis created.\nOn the other hand, if a prototype bean is injected into a singleton\nbean, then each time the singleton bean is called, a new instance of\nthe prototype bean will be created. This is because prototype beans\nare not managed by the container, and a new instance is created\neach time a dependency is injected.\nHere's an example to illustrate this:\n@Component\n@Scope(\"singleton\")\npublic class SingletonBean {\n// code for singleton bean\n}\n@Component\n@Scope(\"prototype\")\npublic class PrototypeBean {\n@Autowired\nprivate SingletonBean singletonBean;\n// code for prototype bean\n}\nIn this example, when a prototype bean is created and injected with\nthe singleton bean, it will receive the same instance of the singleton\nbean each time it is created.

It combines @Controller and\n@ResponseBody annotations, which means that all methods in a\n@RestController class return a response body directly to the client.\nThis response body is usually formatted as JSON or XML, and it can\nbe a simple object, a collection, or any other serializable data.\n@RestController is typically used to build RESTful web services that\nexpose data APIs.\nTo summarize:\n@Controller is used for building web pages or returning views,\nwhere the response can be a view name or a ModelAndView object.\n@RestController is used for building RESTful web services, where the\nresponse is serialized and returned as a response body.\nBoth annotations can be used to handle incoming HTTP requests,\nbut the choice between them depends on the use case and the type\nof response that is required.",

    "answer": "The @ResponseBody annotation is a Spring annotation used in a\ncontroller to indicate that the return value of a method should be\nbound to the web response body. When a method is annotated with\n@ResponseBody, Spring will automatically convert the returned\nvalue to JSON or XML and write it to the response body.\nThis annotation can be used on a method level or on a class level, in\nthe latter case all the methods of the controller will return the\nresponse body.\nHere's an example of a controller method that uses the\n@ResponseBody annotation:\n@Controller\npublic class MyController {\n@ResponseBody\n@RequestMapping(\"/example\")\npublic Object example() {\nreturn new Object();\n}\n}\nIn this example, the example() method returns an object, and the\n@ResponseBody annotation tells Spring to convert the object to\nJSON or XML and write it to the response body.\nIt's important to note that, if you use this annotation on a method,\nSpring will not try to resolve a view for the request and instead it will\ndirectly return the response body.\nAlso, Spring provide the @RestController annotation as a convenient\nalternative, which is a combination of @Controller and\n@ResponseBody, that is typically used for creating RESTful web\nservices.",

    "answer": "In Spring Boot, the HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)\nare mapped to specific Java method handlers using the\n@RequestMapping annotation. To make a POST method idempotent,\nyou would need to change the behavior of the method so that it can\nbe safely called multiple times without changing the result beyond\nthe initial application of the method.\nOne way to achieve this is to use the same unique identifier for the\nresource being created for each subsequent identical request, and\nreturn the existing resource if it already exists. This way, the same\nresource will be created only once and subsequent identical requests\nwill return the existing resource.\nHere is an example of how you could implement an idempotent\nPOST method in Spring Boot:\n@PostMapping(\"/resource\")\npublic ResponseEntity<Resource> createResource(@RequestBody\nResource resource) {\nResource existingResource =\nresourceService.findByUniqueId(resource.getUniqueId());\nif (existingResource != null) {\nreturn new ResponseEntity<>(existingResource,\nHttpStatus.OK);\n} else {\nResource createdResource =\nresourceService.create(resource);\nreturn new ResponseEntity<>(createdResource,\nHttpStatus.CREATED);\n}\n}\nIn the example above, the createResource method checks if a\nresource with the same unique identifier already exists before\ncreating a new one, and returns the existing resource if it does.\nIt's also important to consider the cache-control headers in the\nresponse, to ensure that the request is not cached, so that every\nrequest to the server is done, and the server can check the\nidempotence.\nNote that this is just one way to make a POST method idempotent,\nand other methods can be used depending on the requirements of\nyour specific application.",

    "answer": "Spring Boot provides several options for transaction management,\nincluding declarative and programmatic approaches. The most\ncommon approach is to use the declarative transaction management\nprovided by Spring's @Transactional annotation.\nHere's an example of how you can use the @Transactional\nannotation to manage transactions in a Spring Boot application:\n@Service\npublic class MyService {\n@Autowired\nprivate MyRepository myRepository;\n@Transactional\npublic void updateData(Long id, String data) {\nMyEntity myEntity = myRepository.findById(id);\nmyEntity.setData(data);\nmyRepository.save(myEntity);\n}\n}\nIn the example above, the updateData method is annotated with\n@Transactional, which tells Spring to start a new transaction before\nexecuting the method. When the method completes, Spring will\nautomatically commit the transaction. If an exception is thrown,\nSpring will automatically roll back the transaction.\nYou can also configure the @Transactional annotation to specify the\ntransaction isolation level, the propagation behavior, and other\nproperties. Here's an example of how you can configure the\n@Transactional annotation:\n@Transactional(isolation = Isolation.READ_COMMITTED, timeout =\n30)\nIn this example, the isolation level is set to READ_COMMITTED,\nwhich means that the current transaction can only read data that\nhas been committed by other transactions. The timeout is set to 30\nseconds, which means that the transaction will automatically rollback\nif it takes longer than 30 seconds to complete.\nAnother way to manage transactions in Spring Boot is to use the\nPlatformTransactionManager interface and the TransactionTemplate\nclass. This is called programmatic transaction management. Here's\nan example of how you can use the TransactionTemplate class to\nmanage transactions:\n@Service\npublic class MyService {\n@Autowired\nprivate MyRepository myRepository;\n@Autowired\nprivate TransactionTemplate transactionTemplate;\npublic void updateData(Long id, String data) {\ntransactionTemplate.execute(new\nTransactionCallbackWithoutResult() {\n@Override\nprotected void\ndoInTransactionWithoutResult(TransactionStatus status) {\nMyEntity myEntity = myRepository.findById(id);\nmyEntity.setData(data);\nmyRepository.save(myEntity);\n}\n});\n}\n}\nIn this example, the updateData method uses the\nTransactionTemplate class to execute a transaction. The code that\nneeds to be executed within a transaction is placed in the\ndoInTransactionWithoutResult method. The TransactionTemplate\nclass will automatically start a new transaction before executing the\nmethod, and will automatically commit or roll back the transaction\nbased on the outcome of the method.\nIt's important to note that when using declarative transaction\nmanagement, you need to configure a PlatformTransactionManager\nbean that will be used by the @Transactional annotation, which is\nautomatically done by Spring Boot when using a relational database.\nAlso, you need to make sure that the transaction management\nconfiguration is consistent with the underlying data source and the\nORM framework you use.",

This is the highest level of isolation.\nYou can set the isolation level of a transaction using the isolation\nattribute of the @Transactional annotation.

It's particularly relevant for building Microservice\n-based applications, since Microservice represent a distributed\nsystem and can benefit from the principles of the 12-factor\nmethodology. Here are the 12 factors:\nCodebase: One codebase per app, with multiple deploys.\nDependencies: Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies.\nConfig: Store config in the environment.\nBacking services: Treat backing services as attached resources.\nBuild, release, run: Strictly separate build and run stages.\nProcesses: Execute the app as one or more stateless processes.\nPort binding: Export services via port binding.\nConcurrency: Scale out via the process model.\nDisposability: Maximize robustness with fast start-up and graceful\nshutdown.\nDev/prod parity: Keep development, staging, and production as\nsimilar as possible.\nLogs: Treat logs as event streams.\nAdmin processes: Run admin/management tasks as one-off\nprocesses.\nBy following the principles of the 12-factor methodology, you can\nbuild microservices that are scalable, maintainable, and easily\ndeployable.

    "question": "Why are Microservice stateless?",
    "answer": "Microservice are designed to be stateless for several reasons:\nScalability: Stateless Microservice can be easily scaled horizontally\nby adding more instances, without having to worry about preserving\nstate across instances. This makes it easier to handle increased\ntraffic and load balancing.\nResilience: Stateless microservices can fail without affecting the\nsystem as a whole, since they don't rely on stored state. When a\nstateless microservice fails, another instance can simply take its\nplace, preserving the overall health of the system.\nPortability: Stateless microservices can be deployed to any\nenvironment without having to worry about preserving state. This\nmakes it easier to move microservices between environments, such\nas between development and production, or between data centres.\nSimplicity: Stateless microservices are simpler to implement,\nmaintain, and test, since they don't have to manage state. This\nmakes it easier to build, deploy, and manage a system made up of\nmany microservices.\nIn summary, stateless microservices provide greater scalability,\nresilience, portability, and simplicity compared to stateful\nmicroservices. However, there may be cases where stateful\nmicroservices are necessary, for example, when dealing with user\nsessions or long-running transactions. In these cases, it's important\nto carefully manage state and ensure that stateful microservices are\nstill scalable, resilient, and portable.",

    "answer": "When implementing a microservices architecture, sharing a database\nbetween multiple microservices can be a common approach. Here\nare some guidelines on how to do it effectively:\nDesign the database schema with the microservices in mind: To\nensure that the database can be effectively shared between multiple\nmicroservices, it's important to design the schema with the\nmicroservices architecture in mind. This means creating tables and\ncolumns that are specific to the microservices that will be using\nthem, and avoiding dependencies that would create coupling\nbetween microservices.\nUse a database migration tool: To manage the changes in the\ndatabase schema over time, it's important to use a database\nmigration tool. This will allow you to apply changes to the database\nschema in a controlled way, ensuring that all microservices are\ncompatible with the new schema.\nImplement a database access layer: To abstract the database access\nlogic from the microservices, it's recommended to implement a\ndatabase access layer. This layer should handle all database\noperations and provide a simple interface for the microservices to\ninteract with.\nUse a shared database instance: To ensure that all microservices are\naccessing the same data, it's important to use a shared database\ninstance. This can be a single database server or a cluster of\nservers, depending on the requirements of the system.\nImplement data isolation: To ensure that one microservice does not\nunintentionally modify data that belongs to another microservice, it's\nrecommended to implement data isolation. This can be done by\nusing different database schemas or database instances for each\nmicroservice, or by using row-level security features to restrict\naccess to specific data.\nMonitor database performance: When sharing a database between\nmultiple microservices, it's important to monitor the performance of\nthe database. This can be done by monitoring query execution\ntimes, database locks, and resource usage to ensure that the\ndatabase is performing optimally and not causing performance\nissues for the microservices.\nRegulatory requirements: Some industries have strict regulations\naround data privacy and security.

It is a way to gain visibility into\ncomplex, distributed architectures and to diagnose performance and\nreliability issues.\nDistributed tracing involves instrumenting each service in a\ndistributed system to generate and propagate a unique identifier for\neach incoming request or transaction. This identifier is typically\ncalled a \"trace ID\", and it is used to tie together all the individual\nspans or segments that make up a single transaction.\nAs a transaction flows through the different services and\ncomponents of a distributed system, each component records\ninformation about its part of the transaction in a \"span\" or\n\"segment\". Each span includes information such as timing data,\nerror codes, and other relevant metadata. The spans are then\ncollected and correlated across all the services that participated in\nthe transaction, creating a trace of the entire transaction across the\ndistributed system.\nDistributed tracing is used to understand the performance of a\ndistributed system, to diagnose issues with specific transactions, and\nto identify the root causes of failures or errors. By correlating the\nspans across different services, it is possible to visualize the entire\nflow of a request and to pinpoint bottlenecks, errors, or other issues.\nDistributed tracing tools typically provide visualization tools, alerting\nmechanisms, and other features to help operators and developers\nunderstand the health and performance of their distributed systems.\nDistributed tracing can be implemented using open-source tools like\nJaeger, Zipkin, and OpenTelemetry, or via commercial products from\ncloud providers and third-party vendors.",

This information can include a unique trace\nidentifier, the name of the Microservice, and timing information.\nPropagation: The trace information is propagated along with each\nrequest as it flows between Microservice. This allows the trace\ninformation to be captured and recorded by each Microservice that\nhandles the request.\nCollection: The trace information is collected by a tracing system,\nwhich can be a standalone component or integrated into a log\nmanagement or monitoring tool.\nAnalysis: The collected trace information is analysed to gain\ninsights into the performance and behaviour of the Microservice.\nThis can include identifying bottlenecks, tracking the flow of requests\nthrough the system, and measuring the response time of individual\nMicroservice.\nVisualization: The results of the analysis can be visualized in a way\nthat helps to understand the relationships between microservices\nand identify any issues or inefficiencies.\nDistributed tracing can be performed using dedicated tracing tools,\nsuch as Zipkin, Jaeger, or Appdash, or integrated into existing\nmonitoring and log management tools, such as ELK or Datadog.\nHow to connect internal and external services in\nmicroservices.\nThere are various designs that can be used to connect internal and\nexternal services in a microservice architecture, depending on the\nspecific requirements of the system. Some common patterns are:\nAPI Gateway: An API gateway acts as a single entry point for all\nexternal requests, forwarding them to the appropriate microservice\nfor handling. The gateway can also perform tasks such as\nauthentication, rate limiting, and caching.\nService Discovery: In this pattern, Microservice register\nthemselves with a central registry, and clients use the registry to find\nthe location of the Microservice they need to interact with. This can\nbe done using a technology such as DNS or a dedicated service\ndiscovery tool like Eureka or Consul.\nLoad Balancer: A load balancer distributes incoming requests to\nmultiple instances of a Microservice, improving reliability and\nscalability. Load balancing can be performed by a dedicated load\nbalancing tool, or it can be built into the API gateway.\nCircuit Breaker: A circuit breaker is a pattern that helps prevent\ncascading failures in a Microservice architecture by adding resilience\nto communication between Microservice. The circuit breaker acts as\na proxy between the client and the Microservice, monitoring the\nhealth of the Microservice and failing over to a backup instance if\nnecessary.\nEvent-Driven Architecture: In this pattern, Microservice\ncommunicate with each other using events, rather than direct\nrequests.

It is a\nway to ensure that these transactions maintain data consistency and\nintegrity even in the face of failures and errors.\nIn the Saga pattern, a transaction is divided into a series of smaller,\nmore granular sub-transactions, also known as \"saga steps\", each of\nwhich can be executed independently by a single service. Each sub-\ntransaction updates its own local data and sends messages to other\nservices to trigger their corresponding sub-transactions.\nIf a sub-transaction fails, the Saga pattern uses a compensating\naction to undo the changes made by the previous steps and\nmaintain consistency across the entire transaction. This can be\nthought of as a kind of \"rollback\" mechanism for distributed\ntransactions.\nThe Saga pattern can be implemented in different ways depending\non the specific system and requirements. One common approach is\nto use a choreography-based saga, where each service is responsible\nfor executing its own sub-transactions and communicating with other\nservices directly. Another approach is to use an orchestration-based\nsaga, where a central coordinator service is responsible for executing\nand coordinating the different sub-transactions.\nThe Saga pattern can be a powerful tool for managing long-running\ndistributed transactions, but it also comes with some trade-offs. It\ncan be more complex to implement than simpler transaction models,\nand it can require careful design and testing to ensure that it can\nhandle all possible failure scenarios.

The JVM uses a technique called garbage\ncollection to periodically scan the heap (the area of memory where\nobjects are stored) and identify objects that are no longer being\nused by the application. These objects are then removed from\nmemory, freeing up space for new objects.\nJava has several different garbage collectors that can be used, each\nwith its own set of features and trade-offs. The default garbage\ncollector in most JVMs is called the \"Serial GC\", which is a basic\ngarbage collector that runs serially on a single thread. Other garbage\ncollectors include the \"Parallel GC\", which uses multiple threads to\nspeed up garbage collection, and the \"G1 GC\", which is designed for\nlarge heap sizes and can help reduce the frequency of long pauses\ncaused by garbage collection.\nJava also provides a way for developers to explicitly manage\nmemory through the use of manual memory management\ntechniques such as the new keyword and the finalize() method.\nHowever, it's not recommended to use manual memory management\nin Java, as it can lead to memory leaks and other issues. The JVM's\ngarbage collector does a much better job of managing memory and\nit's better to let it do its job.\nIn addition, Java also provides several memory managements\nrelated flags that can be used to configure the JVM memory usage\nand performance. Such as, -Xmx and -Xms to configure the\nmaximum and minimum heap size, -XX:NewRatio to configure the\nsize of young and old generation, -XX:+UseG1GC to configure the\nG1 Garbage collector.\nIt's worth noting that, effective Memory management requires a\ndeep understanding of JVM internals, Garbage Collection and Java\nMemory Model. Incorrect usage of memory management flags can\nlead to poor performance and stability issues.\nOverall, these changes to the Java Memory Model in Java 8 help to\nimprove the performance and safety of multi-threaded Java\napplications.",

    "question": "What benefits does it offer?",
    "answer": "In Java 8 and later, the Meta-Space is a memory space that is used\nto store class metadata. It is separate from the Java heap, which is\nused to store objects and other data.\nThe MetaSpace is used to store information about classes and\ninterfaces, such as their methods, fields, and annotations. This\ninformation is used by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to dynamically\nload and link classes at runtime.\nThe MetaSpace is allocated a fixed amount of memory, which is\nspecified using the -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize command-line option.\nWhen the MetaSpace is full, the JVM will attempt to free up space by\nunloading classes that are no longer in use. If this is not sufficient,\nthe JVM will throw a java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Metaspace error.\nIt is important to monitor the MetaSpace usage and adjust the -\nXX:MaxMetaspaceSize as necessary to ensure that there is enough\nspace for the classes that are needed at runtime.\nIt's worth noting that, starting from Java 11, the MetaSpace has\nbeen replaced by the \"Class Data Sharing\" (CDS) feature.

    "answer": "An \"Out of Memory\" error in Java occurs when the application\nrequests more memory from the JVM than is available. This can\nhappen for a number of reasons, such as:\nThe application is using more memory than is available on the\nsystem: The JVM has a maximum limit on the amount of memory it\ncan use, which is determined by the -Xmx command line option. If\nthe application is using more memory than this limit, an Out of\nMemory error will occur.\nMemory leaks: If an application holds onto objects that are no\nlonger needed, it can cause the JVM to run out of memory. This is\nknown as a memory leak.\nInsufficient heap size: The heap is the area of memory where the\nJVM stores objects. If the heap size is not large enough, the JVM\nmay not be able to allocate enough memory for the application's\nneeds, resulting in an Out of Memory error.\nHigh usage of non-heap memory: The JVM also uses non-heap\nmemory for things like class metadata, JIT compilation data and\nnative resources. If the non-heap memory usage is high, it can\ncause Out of Memory error.\nTo fix an Out of Memory error, you will need to identify the cause of\nthe problem and take steps to address it.

However, in some situations,\nit may be necessary to break the Singleton pattern and create\nmultiple instances of the class. Here are some common techniques\nfor breaking the Singleton pattern:\nUse Dependency Injection: One way to break the Singleton\npattern is to use dependency injection to pass an instance of the\nSingleton class into other classes that require it. This allows multiple\ninstances to be created, and can be useful when testing or when you\nneed to have different instances with different configurations.\nUse Reflection: Another way to break the Singleton pattern is to\nuse reflection to access the private constructor of the Singleton class\nand create a new instance. This is not recommended in most cases,\nas it can cause unexpected behavior and can be a security risk.\nUse a Subclass: You can also create a subclass of the Singleton\nclass and override its behavior.

    "answer": "Adaptor design pattern:\nThe Adapter design pattern is a structural pattern that allows two\nincompatible interfaces to work together. It converts the interface of\none class into another interface that clients expect. This pattern is\noften used when an existing class's interface does not match the\ninterface required by a client, or when a client needs to work with\nmultiple classes that have different interfaces.\nThe Adapter pattern involves the following components:\nTarget Interface: This is the interface that the client expects to work\nwith.\nAdaptee: This is the class that has the interface that does not match\nthe target interface.\nAdapter: This is the class that adapts the interface of the Adaptee to\nthe Target Interface.\nThe Adapter pattern can be implemented in two ways: Class Adapter\nand Object Adapter.\nIn the Class Adapter approach, the Adapter class extends the\nAdaptee class and implements the Target Interface. The Adapter\nclass inherits the behavior of the Adaptee class and adds the\nbehavior required to match the Target Interface.\nIn the Object Adapter approach, the Adapter class contains an\ninstance of the Adaptee class and implements the Target Interface.\nThe Adapter class delegates the requests from the client to the\nAdaptee instance and adds the behavior required to match the\nTarget Interface.\nHere's an example to illustrate how the Adapter pattern works:\nSuppose you have a client that expects a simple interface for a\nprinter that only has a print() method. However, you have an\nexisting class called AdvancedPrinter that has a complex interface\nwith multiple methods. You can create an Adapter class that adapts\nthe interface of the AdvancedPrinter to the simple interface expected\nby the client. The Adapter class would have a print() method that\ncalls the appropriate methods on the AdvancedPrinter to accomplish\nthe print operation. The client can then use the Adapter class to\nprint documents without having to know about the complex interface\nof the AdvancedPrinter.\nProxy Design pattern:\nThe Proxy design pattern is a structural pattern that provides a\nsurrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.\nThe Proxy pattern allows you to create a representative object that\ncan act as an intermediary between a client and the real object. The\nproxy object can perform additional functionality such as security\nchecks, caching, or remote communication.\nThe Proxy pattern involves the following components:\nSubject: This is the interface that both the Real Subject and the\nProxy implement. It defines the common interface for the Real\nSubject and the Proxy so that the client can work with both objects\ninterchangeably.\nReal Subject: This is the object that the client wants to access. It\nimplements the Subject interface and provides the real\nimplementation of the operations.\nProxy: This is the object that acts as a surrogate for the Real\nSubject. It also implements the Subject interface and forwards the\nrequests from the client to the Real Subject. In addition to\nforwarding requests, the Proxy may also perform additional\nfunctionality such as caching, logging, or security checks.\nThe Proxy pattern can be implemented in several ways, including:\nVirtual Proxy: This is a type of Proxy that creates an object on\ndemand. When the client requests an operation, the Virtual Proxy\nchecks whether the Real Subject has been created, and if not, it\ncreates it. This is useful when creating the Real Subject is expensive,\nand you want to delay its creation until it is actually needed.\nProtection Proxy: This is a type of Proxy that checks whether the\nclient has the necessary permissions to access the Real Subject. If\nthe client has the required permissions, the Proxy forwards the\nrequest to the Real Subject. Otherwise, it denies the request.\nRemote Proxy: This is a type of Proxy that acts as a local\nrepresentative for a remote object. When the client requests an\noperation, the Remote Proxy forwards the request to the remote\nobject and returns the result.\nHere's an example to illustrate how the Proxy pattern works:\nSuppose you have a resource-intensive object that needs to be\naccessed frequently. You can create a Proxy object that acts as a\nsurrogate for the real object. The Proxy object can cache the results\nof the operations and return the cached results to the client when\nthe same operation is requested again.

It is a structural pattern that\nallows objects to have additional behavior or responsibilities without\nthe need to create a subclass of the original object.\nIn the Decorator pattern, a set of decorator classes are created that\nadd new functionality to the original object. These decorators\nconform to the same interface as the object being decorated, and\nthey contain a reference to the object they are decorating. The\ndecorators can add new behavior to the object by intercepting its\nmethod calls and modifying their behavior or adding new\nfunctionality.\nHere are some key features of the Decorator pattern:\nIt is a way to extend the functionality of an object without sub\nclassing.\nDecorators can be stacked on top of each other to add multiple\nlayers of functionality.\nDecorators can be added and removed at runtime, which makes it\neasy to change an object's behaviour dynamically.\nThe original object can remain unchanged, which helps to ensure\nthat existing code and unit tests still work as expected.\nThe Decorator pattern allows for a clear separation of concerns\nbetween the object being decorated and the code that adds new\nbehaviour.\nA common real-world example of the Decorator pattern is with\nstreaming services. For example, a user might have a basic\nstreaming service that allows them to access a limited library of\ncontent. They can then choose to add a set of decorator services,\nsuch as one for high-definition video, another for access to live\nevents, and yet another for access to an expanded library of\ncontent.

    "question": "Write a SQL query to remove duplicate employee records?",
    "answer": "The SQL query to remove duplicate employee records will depend on\nthe definition of \"duplicate\". Here's a general query that removes\nduplicate records based on all columns in the table:\nDELETE FROM employee\nWHERE id NOT IN (\nSELECT MIN(id)\nFROM employee\nGROUP BY column1, column2, ...\n);\nIn this query, the subquery selects the minimum id for each group of\nduplicate records. The outer query then deletes all records whose id\nis not in the subquery result, effectively removing all duplicate\nrecords except one.\nYou can replace column1, column2, ... with the specific columns that\ndefine a duplicate record. For example, if two employee records are\nconsidered duplicates if they have the same first name, last name,\nand hire date, the query would look like this:\nDELETE FROM employee\nWHERE id NOT IN (\nSELECT MIN(id)\nFROM employee\nGROUP BY first_name, last_name, hire_date\n);\nWrite a query to find employee numbers in each department.\nTo find the number of employees in each department, you can use\nthe SQL GROUP BY clause with the COUNT() aggregate function.\nHere's an example query that should work in most relational\ndatabase management systems (RDBMS):\nSELECT department, COUNT(*) as num_employees\nFROM employees\nGROUP BY department\nIn this query, we select the department column from the employees\ntable and count the number of employees in each department using\nthe COUNT(*) aggregate function. We also give the count column an\nalias num_employees.\nThe GROUP BY clause groups the results by the department column,\nso we get one row for each unique department in the employees\ntable.\nThe output of this query would be a list of departments with the\nnumber of employees in each department.\nFor example, if we have an employees table with columns\nemployee_id, employee_name, department, and salary, and some\nsample data like this:\nemployee_id | employee_name | department | salary\n------------+---------------+------------+-------\n1 | Alice | HR | 50000\n2 | Bob | IT | 60000\n3 | Charlie | IT | 55000\n4 | Dave | HR | 45000\n5 | Eve | Marketing | 70000\n6 | Frank | IT | 65000\n7 | Grace | Marketing | 60000\n8 | Harry | HR | 55000\n9 | Ivan | IT | 70000\nThen, the output of the query would be:\ndepartment | num_employees\n-----------+--------------\nHR | 3\nIT | 4\nMarketing | 2\nIn this output, we can see that there are three employees in the HR\ndepartment, four employees in the IT department, and two\nemployees in the Marketing department.",

    "answer": "Yes, I am familiar with database triggers and how they work.\nA trigger is a database object that is automatically executed in\nresponse to certain events, such as changes to data in a table.\nTriggers are typically used to enforce business rules, audit changes\nto data, or synchronize data across different tables or databases.\nTriggers are associated with a specific table or view and can be set\nto execute either before or after an event occurs. The events that\ncan trigger a trigger include inserts, updates, and deletes to the\ntable. When a trigger is fired, it can execute one or more SQL\nstatements or call a stored procedure.\nThe basic syntax for creating a trigger in SQL is as follows:\nCREATE [OR REPLACE] TRIGGER trigger_name\n{BEFORE | AFTER} {INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE}\nON table_name\n[FOR EACH ROW]\nBEGIN\n-- Trigger logic here\nEND;\nIn this example, trigger_name is the name of the trigger,\ntable_name is the name of the table or view that the trigger is\nassociated with, and BEFORE or AFTER specifies when the trigger\nshould be executed. The FOR EACH ROW clause indicates that the\ntrigger should execute once for each row affected by the triggering\nevent.\nOnce a trigger is created, it is automatically executed whenever the\nspecified event occurs. Triggers can be a powerful tool for enforcing\ndata integrity and automating database tasks, but it's important to\nuse them judiciously to avoid performance issues and unexpected\nresults.",

    "question": "Explain database Joins?",
    "answer": "In a relational database, data is typically stored in multiple tables.\nDatabase joins are used to combine data from two or more tables\ninto a single result set based on a common column or set of\ncolumns.\nThere are several types of joins in a relational database, including:\nInner Join: An inner join returns only the rows that have matching\nvalues in both tables being joined. The join is performed by\ncomparing values in the columns that are common to both tables.\nLeft Join: A left join returns all the rows from the left table and the\nmatching rows from the right table. If there is no matching row in\nthe right table, the result will contain null values for the right table\ncolumns.\nRight Join: A right join is similar to a left join, but it returns all the\nrows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table.\nIf there is no matching row in the left table, the result will contain\nnull values for the left table columns.\nFull Outer Join: A full outer join returns all the rows from both\ntables, including those that do not have matching values in the other\ntable. If there is no matching row in one of the tables, the result will\ncontain null values for the columns of the missing table.\nCross Join: A cross join returns the Cartesian product of the two\ntables, which means that every row from one table is combined with\nevery row from the other table.\nHere's an example to illustrate how a join works:\nSuppose you have two tables: Customers and Orders. The\nCustomers table has columns for CustomerID, Name, and Address,\nwhile the Orders table has columns for OrderID, CustomerID, and\nOrderDate. You can join these two tables to get a result set that\ncontains information about customers and their orders.\nTo perform an inner join on these tables, you would match the rows\nin the Customers table with the rows in the Orders table based on\nthe CustomerID column. The resulting joined table would contain\nonly the rows where there is a matching value in both tables.\nTo perform a left join on these tables, you would return all the rows\nfrom the Customers table and the matching rows from the Orders\ntable based on the CustomerID column. If there is no matching row\nin the Orders table, the result would contain null values for the\nOrderID and OrderDate columns.\nTo perform a right join on these tables, you would return all the\nrows from the Orders table and the matching rows from the\nCustomers table based on the CustomerID column. If there is no\nmatching row in the Customers table, the result would contain null\nvalues for the Name and Address columns.\nThese are just a few examples of how joins can be used to combine\ndata from multiple tables in a relational database.",

    "question": "What is complex join in Hibernate?",
    "answer": "Hibernate is a powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework\nthat allows you to work with complex join queries.\nOne way to perform complex join queries in Hibernate is to use the\nCriteria API, which allows you to build queries programmatically. The\nCriteria API provides a fluent and type-safe way to construct queries,\nand it supports a wide variety of operations, including inner and\nouter joins, subqueries, and projections.\nHere's an example of how you can use the Criteria API to perform an\ninner join:\nCriteria criteria = session.createCriteria(Order.class, \"o\")\n.createAlias(\"o.customer\", \"c\")\n.add(Restrictions.eq(\"c.name\", \"John\"))\n.setProjection(Projections.property(\"o.total\"))\n.addOrder(Order.desc(\"o.total\"));\nList results = criteria.list();\nIn this example, the createAlias() method is used to create an inner\njoin between the Order and Customer entities on the customer\nproperty of the Order entity. The Restrictions.eq() method is used to\nadd a filter on the name property of the Customer entity, and the\nsetProjection() method is used to select the total property of the\nOrder entity.\nAnother way to perform complex join queries in Hibernate is to use\nthe HQL (Hibernate Query Language) which is similar to SQL.\nQuery query = session.createQuery(\"SELECT o.total FROM Order o\nJOIN o.customer c WHERE c.name = :name ORDER BY o.total\nDESC\");\nquery.setParameter(\"name\", \"John\");\nList results = query.list();\nIn this example, the JOIN clause is used to create an inner join\nbetween the Order and Customer entities on the customer property\nof the Order entity. The WHERE clause is used to add a filter on the\nname property of the Customer entity, and the ORDER BY clause is\nused to sort the results by the total property of the Order entity.\nIn conclusion, hibernate provides several ways to perform complex\njoin queries, such as the Criteria API and HQL.",

    "question": "How to store and navigate hierarchies?",
    "answer": "Storing and navigating hierarchies can be accomplished in several\nways, depending on the specific needs of the application. Here are a\nfew common approaches:\nAdjacency List Model: In this model, each node in the hierarchy is\nstored as a record in a database table, with a column that references\nthe parent node. This makes it easy to navigate the hierarchy, as\nyou can simply perform a recursive query to retrieve all the\ndescendants of a given node. However, this approach can be\ninefficient for very large hierarchies, as it requires multiple database\nqueries.\nNested Set Model: In this model, each node is represented by two\ncolumns in the database table, which indicate the range of nodes\nthat fall within its subtree. This approach can be more efficient than\nthe adjacency list model for navigating hierarchies, as it only\nrequires a single query to retrieve all the descendants of a given\nnode. However, it can be more complex to implement, as it requires\nmaintaining the nested set values when nodes are added, deleted,\nor moved.\nMaterialized Path Model: In this model, each node is represented by\na string that includes the path to the root node, delimited by a\nseparator (e.g. /). This approach can be efficient for querying a\nspecific node or subtree, as it only requires a simple string\ncomparison. However, it can be less efficient for complex queries or\nfor updating the hierarchy, as it requires updating the paths of all\nthe affected nodes.\nClosure Table Model: In this model, a separate table is created to\nrepresent the relationships between nodes in the hierarchy. Each\nrecord in the closure table represents a direct path between two\nnodes in the hierarchy, allowing for efficient queries and updates.\nHowever, this approach can be more complex to implement and can\nrequire more storage space than the other models.\nOnce you've decided on a model for storing hierarchies, navigating\nthe hierarchy can be accomplished by querying the database for the\nappropriate nodes and relationships, and using recursion or iteration\nto traverse the tree structure. The specific approach will depend on\nthe details of the model and the requirements of the application.",

    "question": "What is the data type of the index in Database?",
    "answer": "In a database, the data type of an index depends on the type of\ndata being indexed.\nFor example, if the index is created on a column that contains string\nvalues, such as a column that stores the names of customers, the\nindex data type will likely be a string type, such as VARCHAR or\nTEXT. If the index is created on a column that contains numeric\nvalues, such as a column that stores prices, the index data type will\nlikely be a numeric type, such as INT or DECIMAL.\nIn general, the index data type should match the data type of the\ncolumn being indexed. This ensures that the index can be used\nefficiently to speed up queries that search for specific values in the\ncolumn. It's also important to consider the length of the indexed\nvalues, as longer values may require more storage space and may\naffect the performance of the index.\nIt's worth noting that in addition to the data type of the indexed\ncolumn, the database may also use a specific data structure for the\nindex, such as a B-tree or hash table, to improve the efficiency of\nindex lookups.

    "question": "What is the differences between Indexing and Partitioning?",
    "answer": "Indexing and partitioning are two common techniques used in\ndatabase optimization, but they have different purposes and use\ncases.\nIndexing is the process of creating an index on one or more columns\nin a table, in order to speed up the retrieval of data from that table.\nAn index is a data structure that is used to improve the performance\nof search operations on a table by allowing the database to find\nspecific rows more quickly. Indexes can be created on single or\nmultiple columns and can be either unique or non-unique. Indexing\ncan help to improve the performance of read operations on the\ntable, but it can also have a negative impact on the performance of\nwrite operations, as the index must be updated every time data is\ninserted, updated or deleted.\nPartitioning, on the other hand, is the process of dividing a large\ntable into smaller, more manageable pieces called partitions, based\non some criteria such as date range or geographic location.\nPartitioning can improve the performance of both read and write\noperations on the table by allowing the database to process only the\nnecessary partitions, instead of the entire table. Partitioning can also\nhelp with data management, as it allows administrators to more\neasily archive or delete old data.\nIn summary, the main difference between indexing and partitioning\nis that indexing is used to improve the performance of search\noperations on a table, while partitioning is used to improve the\nperformance of both read and write operations on a large table.\nBoth techniques can be used together to optimize the performance\nof a database, but they should be chosen based on the specific use\ncase and requirements of the application.\nExplain the Hibernate-JPA structure.\nHibernate is a powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework\nthat allows you to work with databases in a Java-based application.\nIt is based on the JPA (Java Persistence API) standard, which is the\nJava standard for ORM.\nThe main components of the Hibernate-JPA structure are:\nEntity: An entity represents a table in the database, and it is mapped\nto a Java class. Each entity has a set of fields, which represent the\ncolumns in the table, and it also has a set of methods to interact\nwith the data.\nEntityManager: The Entity Manager is the main interface for\ninteracting with the database. It provides methods for performing\nCRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, as well as methods\nfor querying the database.\nEntityManagerFactory: The Entity Manager Factory is responsible for\ncreating and managing EntityManager instances. It is typically\ncreated once during application initialization and is used to create\nEntityManager instances for each database transaction.\nPersistence Unit: The Persistence Unit defines the configuration\nsettings for the Entity Manager Factory, such as the data source,\ndatabase dialect, and mapping information.\nEntityManager and Session: Entity Manager is the interface defined\nby JPA, Session is the interface defined by Hibernate. Entity Manager\nis built on top of the Session, and it provides a simpler, more\nconsistent interface for working with JPA entities.\nTransaction: A transaction represents a unit of work that is\nperformed against the database. A transaction can include one or\nmore operations, such as inserting, updating, or deleting data.\nMapping files: Hibernate uses XML or annotations in the entity\nclasses to map the entities to the database tables and columns. It\ndefines the relationship between the entities and how the entities\nshould be persisted and retrieved from the database.\nIn summary, Hibernate-JPA structure is based on the JPA standard, it\nallows you to work with databases in a Java-based application.

    "question": "How to sort the employee list in ascending and descending\norder using java 8 streams API?",
    "answer": "You can use the sorted method of the Stream API in Java 8 to sort a\nlist of employees in ascending or descending order. By default, the\nsorted method sorts the elements in the stream in natural order,\nwhich means that it uses the elements' compareTo method if the\nelements are Comparable, or it throws a ClassCastException if they\nare not.\nHere's an example of how you can sort a list of employees in\nascending order based on their salary:\nList<Employee> employees = getEmployeeList(); // get the list of\nemployees\nemployees.stream()\n.sorted(Comparator.comparing(Employee::getSalary))\n.forEach(System.out::println);\nAnd here's an example of how you can sort the same list in\ndescending order based on the employee's name:\nemployees.stream()\n.sorted(Comparator.comparing(Employee::getName).reversed\n())\n.forEach(System.out::println);\nNote that the reversed method on the comparator returns a\ncomparator that gives the opposite ordering of the original\ncomparator.\nFind the highest salary of an employee from the HR\ndepartment using Java stream API.\nYou have been given an employee list with EMP<Id, Name, Salary,\nDeptt>, and\nYou can use the filter and max methods of the Stream API in Java 8\nto find the highest salary of an employee from the HR department.\nHere's an example:\nList<Employee> employees = getEmployeeList(); // get the list of\nemployees\nOptional<Employee> highestPaidHrEmployee = employees.stream()\n.filter(e ->\n\"HR\".equals(e.getDeptt()))\n.max(Comparator.comparing(E\nmployee::getSalary));\nif (highestPaidHrEmployee.isPresent()) {\nSystem.out.println(\"The highest paid HR employee is: \" +\nhighestPaidHrEmployee.get().getName());\n} else {\nSystem.out.println(\"No HR employees found in the list.\");\n}\nIn this example, the filter method is used to select only the\nemployees from the HR department, and the max method is used to\nfind the employee with the highest salary. The max method returns\nan Optional object that may or may not contain the maximum value,\ndepending on whether the stream is empty or not. So we use the\nisPresent method to check if a value was found before accessing it.\nFind all employees who live in ‘Pune’ city, sort them by their\nname, and print the names of employees using Stream API.\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.Comparator;\nimport java.util.List;\npublic class Employee {\nprivate String name;\nprivate String city;\npublic Employee(String name, String city) {\nthis.name = name;\nthis.city = city;\n}\npublic String getName() {\nreturn name;\n}\npublic String getCity() {\nreturn city;\n}\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n// Creating a list of employees\nList<Employee> employees = new ArrayList<>();\nemployees.add(new Employee(\"John Smith\", \"New York\"));\nemployees.add(new Employee(\"Jane Doe\", \"Chicago\"));\nemployees.add(new Employee(\"Bob Johnson\", \"Pune\"));\nemployees.add(new Employee(\"Sarah Lee\", \"Pune\"));\n// Filtering and sorting employees who live in Pune\nList<Employee> puneEmployees = employees.stream()\n.filter(e -> e.getCity().equals(\"Pune\"))\n.sorted(Comparator.comparing(Employee::getName))\n.toList();\n// Printing the names of employees who live in Pune\nSystem.out.println(\"Employees who live in Pune:\");\npuneEmployees.stream()\n.map(Employee::getName)\n.forEach(System.out::println);\n}\n}\nThe code uses the filter method to filter out employees who live in\nPune, then the sorted method to sort them by name, and finally, the\nmap method to extract the names of the employees.

Here's an example code\nsnippet:\nString str = \"Hello, world!\";\nMap<Integer, Long> charCount = str.chars()\n.boxed()\n.collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Function.identity(),\nCollectors.counting()));\ncharCount.forEach((k, v) -> System.out.println(\"Character '\" +\n(char) k.intValue() + \"' occurs \" + v + \" times.\"));\noutput:\nCharacter ' ' occurs 1 times.\nCharacter ',' occurs 1 times.\nCharacter 'H' occurs 1 times.\nCharacter 'e' occurs 1 times.\nCharacter 'd' occurs 1 times.\nCharacter 'l' occurs 3 times.\nCharacter 'o' occurs 2 times.\nCharacter 'r' occurs 1 times.\nCharacter 'w' occurs 1 times.\nCharacter '!' occurs 1 times.\nIn this example, the groupingBy() method groups the characters by\ntheir Unicode code points, and the counting() method counts the\nnumber of occurrences of each character. The resulting map\ncharCount contains the counts for each character, which we can print\nout using a forEach() loop.",

If\neither of these conditions is true, we return false.\nWe create a boolean array of size 128, which will be used to keep\ntrack of whether a character has been seen before or not.\nWe iterate through each character of the input string and convert it\nto its ASCII value. We check if the corresponding index in the\nboolean array is already true. If it is, it means that the character has\nbeen seen before and we return false. Otherwise, we mark the\ncorresponding index in the boolean array as true.\nIf we have iterated through the entire string without finding any\nrepeated characters, we return true.\nHere's how you can call this function with the input string \"india\"\nand print the result:\nString input = \"india\";\nboolean hasUnique = hasUniqueChars(input);\nSystem.out.println(hasUnique); // This will print false, since 'i'",

    "answer": "Sending a large amount of data, such as 1GB, in a single request\ncan have significant performance and scalability issues, such as\nincreased memory usage, longer response times, and increased\nnetwork bandwidth utilization.\nOne common solution to handle large data sets is to use pagination,\nwhere the data is split into smaller chunks and sent in multiple\nrequests. However, if you are not able to use pagination, there are a\nfew alternative solutions you can consider:\nCompression: You can compress the data before sending it back in\nthe response. This can reduce the amount of data sent over the\nnetwork and improve the response time. You can use algorithms\nsuch as GZIP to compress the data.\nStreaming: You can stream the data from the database directly to\nthe response without storing it in memory. This can reduce the\nmemory usage and allow you to handle large data sets more\nefficiently. You can use the Java API for Streaming XML (StAX) to\nstream the data.\nAsynchronous Processing: You can implement asynchronous\nprocessing to fetch and send the data in the background.

    "answer": "Basically, the interviewer wants to know\nhow you would design a database in a hierarchical way.\nA binary tree is a hierarchical data structure that can be easily\nmodelled in a relational database. To design a binary tree in a\ndatabase, you need to create a table to represent the nodes of the\ntree and a self-referencing foreign key to represent the parent-child\nrelationships.\nHere's an example of how you can design a binary tree in a\nrelational database:\nCREATE TABLE node (\nid INT PRIMARY KEY,\ndata VARCHAR(255),\nparent_id INT,\nFOREIGN KEY (parent_id) REFERENCES node (id)\n);\nIn this example, the node table has four columns: id, data,\nparent_id, and a self-referencing foreign key parent_id that refers to\nthe id of the parent node. The root node of the tree will have a NULL\nvalue in the parent_id column, and the other nodes will have a\nreference to their parent node.\nYou can use SQL queries to traverse the tree and perform various\noperations, such as inserting, updating, and deleting nodes.

    "answer": "Storing millions of records in a single table can lead to performance\nand scalability issues, as the table size increases and the query\nresponse time becomes longer. To handle such a large number of\nrecords, you can use the following strategies:\nPartitioning: Partitioning the table into smaller, more manageable\nchunks, based on a specific criterion, can improve the performance\nand scalability of the system. For example, you can partition the\ndata by date, so that each partition contains data for a specific time\nrange. You can use either horizontal partitioning, where the data is\nsplit across multiple tables, or vertical partitioning, where the data is\nsplit across multiple columns in the same table.\nSharding: Sharding is a method of distributing the data across\nmultiple databases to increase the scalability and performance of the\nsystem. You can shard the data based on specific criteria, such as\ngeographic location or user ID, so that each shard contains a subset\nof the data.\nDenormalization: You can denormalize the data by duplicating data\nacross multiple tables to reduce the number of joins required to\nretrieve the data. This can improve the performance of the queries\nand reduce the response time.\nIndexing: Indexing the columns used in the queries can improve the\nquery performance and reduce the response time. You can use\neither clustered or non-clustered indexes, depending on the specific\nrequirements.\nIn addition, you can use database patterns, such as the Star\nSchema, to design the database and improve the performance and\nscalability of the system. The Star Schema is a data warehousing\npattern that uses a central fact table to store the data and dimension\ntables to store the metadata. This pattern can improve the query\nperformance and reduce the response time for large data sets.\nIn summary, storing millions of records in a single table requires\ncareful planning and design, and you can use a combination of\npartitioning, sharding, denormalization, indexing, and database\npatterns to improve the performance and scalability of the system.",

    "question": "How can you handle this situation?",
    "answer": "One way to handle this situation is to use the Aspect-Oriented\nProgramming (AOP) technique. In AOP, you can define \"aspects\"\nthat represent a set of cross-cutting concerns, such as logging or\nerror handling, that can be applied to multiple points in your code in\na modular and reusable way.\nIn your case, you can define an aspect to handle specific conditions\nbefore calling Service B, C, and D. The aspect can include code to\nlog the conditions or perform error handling, and you can apply the\naspect to the methods in Service A that call Service B, C, and D.\nTo implement this in Java, you can use a framework like Spring AOP.\nIn Spring AOP, you can define aspects using annotations and apply\nthem to your code using pointcuts. For example:\n@Aspect\n@Component\npublic class ServiceALogger {\n@Before(\"execution(* com.example.ServiceA.*(..))\")\npublic void logBefore(JoinPoint joinPoint) {\n// Log or handle specific conditions before calling B, C, and D\n}\n}\nIn this example, the @Before annotation is used to define an aspect\nthat will be executed before each method in the\ncom.example.ServiceA class. The logBefore method contains the\ncode to log or handle specific conditions before calling Service B, C,\nand D.\nBy using AOP, you can centralize the handling of specific conditions\nin a single aspect and apply it to multiple points in your code in a\ngeneric way.

The child class will\nhave access to the same instance as the parent, and any\nmodifications made to that instance in the parent or child class will\nbe visible to both classes.\nHowever, if the child class overrides the Singleton-specific methods\nor properties of the parent class, it may break the Singleton pattern.\nThis is because the child class may create its own instance of the\nSingleton, or modify the existing Singleton instance in ways that are\nnot compatible with the Singleton pattern.

Here's a rundown of its key\naspects:\nWhat it does:\nIntroduces type patterns instead of just checking against a single\ntype.\nAllows declaring a variable within the instanceof check to hold the\nextracted object.\nCombines type checking and casting into a single, more concise and\nreadable expression.\nBenefits:\nReduced boilerplate: Eliminates the need for separate instanceof\nchecks, casts, and variable declarations.\nImproved readability: Makes code clearer and easier to understand,\nespecially for complex type hierarchies.\nReduced errors: Less chance of casting exceptions due to mistaken\ntypes.\nSyntax:\nif (obj instanceof String s) {\n// Use \"s\" directly as a String here\n} else if (obj instanceof List<Integer> list) {\n// Use \"list\" directly as a List<Integer> here\n} else {\n// Handle other cases\n}\nExample\npublic class PatternMatchingForInstanceof {\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\nObject o = new Book(\"Harry Potter\", Set.of(\"Jon Doe\"));\n// old way\nif (o instanceof Book) {\nBook book = (Book) o;\nprint(\"The book's author(s) are \" + book.getAuthors());\n}\n// new way\nif (o instanceof Book book) {\nprint(\"The book's author(s) are \" + book.getAuthors());\n}\n}\n}\nRecord:\nRecords in Java are a special type of class specifically designed for\nholding immutable data. They help reduce boilerplate code and\nimprove readability and maintainability when dealing with simple\ndata structures.\nHere’s a breakdown of their key characteristics:\n1. Conciseness:\nUnlike traditional classes, records require minimal code to define.\nYou just specify the data fields (components) in the record\ndeclaration, and the compiler automatically generates essential\nmethods like:\nConstructor with parameters for each component.\nGetters for each component.\nequals and hashCode methods based on component values.\ntoString method representing the record's state.\n2. Immutability:\nRecord fields are declared as final, making the data stored within\nthem unmodifiable after the record is created. This ensures data\nconsistency and simplifies thread safety concerns.\n3. Readability:\nThe auto-generated methods and predictable behavior of records\nenhance code clarity and make it easier to understand what the\nrecord represents and how it interacts with other parts of your\nprogram.\n4. Reduced Errors:\nBy minimizing boilerplate, records reduce the risk of common\nmistakes like forgetting getters or implementing equals incorrectly.\nThis leads to more robust and reliable code.\nOverall, records are a valuable tool for Java developers to create\nconcise, immutable, and readable data structures, leading to cleaner,\nmore maintainable code.\n/**\n* Record are data-only immutable classes (thus have specific use\ncases)\n* They are a restricted (specialized) form of a class (like enums)\n* Not suitable for objects that are meant to change state, etc.\n* <p>\n* Records are NOT:\n* - Boilerplate reduction mechanism\n* <p>\n* Records generate constructors, getters, fields; equals, hashCode,\ntoString\n* <p>\n* Use cases:\n* - to model immutable data\n* - to hold read-only data in memory\n* - DTOs - Data Transfer Objects\n*/\npublic class RecordsDemo {\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\nProduct p1 = new Product(\"milk\", 50);\nProduct p2 = new Product(\"milk\", 50);\nprint(p1.price()); // without \"get\" prefix\nprint(p1); // auto-generated toString() -\nProduct[name=milk, price=50]\nprint(p1 == p2); // false - different objects\nprint(p1.equals(p2)); // true - values of fields (milk, 50)\nare compared by the auto-generated equals()/hashCode()\n}\n}\n/**\n* params are called \"Components\"\n* want more fields - must add into the signature\n* Extending not allowed, implementing interfaces IS allowed\n*/\npublic record Product(String name, int price) {\n// static fields allowed, but not non-static\nstatic String country = \"US\";\n// constructor with all fields is generated\n// can add validation\npublic Product {\nif(price < 0) {\nthrow new IllegalArgumentException();\n}\n}\n// possible to override auto-generated methods like toString()\n}\n2.Date Time Formatter API:\nGeneral usage and features of the DateTimeFormatter API in Java\n16: This includes understanding format patterns, creating custom\nformats, parsing dates and times, and available formatting options.\nNew features introduced in Java 16 for date formatting: Specifically,\nthe day period support using the \"B\" symbol and its various styles.\nComparison of DateTimeFormatter with older formatters like\nSimpleDateFormat: Exploring the advantages and disadvantages of\neach approach.\nExamples of using DateTimeFormatter for specific formatting tasks:\nLike formatting dates in different locales, handling time zones, or\ngenerating human-readable representations.\npublic class DateTimeFormatterApi {\nstatic Map<TextStyle, Locale> map = Map.of(\nTextStyle.FULL, Locale.US,\nTextStyle.SHORT, Locale.FRENCH,\nTextStyle.NARROW, Locale.GERMAN\n);\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\nfor (var entry : map.entrySet()) {\nLocalDateTime now = LocalDateTime.now();\nDateTimeFormatter formatter = new\nDateTimeFormatterBuilder()\n.appendPattern(\"yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm \")\n.appendDayPeriodText(entry.getKey()) // at night,\ndu soir, abends, etc.\n.toFormatter(entry.getValue());\nString formattedDateTime = now.format(formatter);\nprint(formattedDateTime);\n}\n}\n}\n3.Changes in Stream API:\nJava 16 brought some exciting changes to the Stream API, making it\neven more powerful and convenient to use. Here are the key\nhighlights:\n1. Stream.toList() method: This new method provides a concise way\nto collect the elements of a stream into a List. Previously, you had to\nuse collect(Collectors.toList()), which is now slightly redundant.\n2. Stream.mapMulti() method: This method allows you to map each\nelement of a stream to zero or more elements, creating a new\nstream of the resulting elements. It's handy for splitting or flattening\ncomplex data structures.\n3. Enhanced line terminator handling: Java 16 clarifies the definition\nof line terminators in the java.io.LineNumberReader class. This\neliminates inconsistencies and ensures consistent behavior when\nreading line-based data.\n4. Other minor changes:\nString streams now support the limit and skip methods directly,\nremoving the need for intermediate operations.\nThe peek method can now be used with parallel streams, allowing\nside effects without impacting parallelism.\npublic class StreamApi {\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\nList<Integer> ints = Stream.of(1, 2, 3)\n.filter(n -> n < 3)\n.toList(); // new, instead of the verbose\n.collect(Collectors.toList())\nints.forEach(System.out::println);\n}\n}\nJava 17 Features\n1.Sealed classes(Subclassing):\nSealed classes are a brand-new feature introduced in Java 17 (JEP\n409) that gives you more control over inheritance hierarchies. They\nessentially let you restrict which classes can extend or implement\nyour class or interface. This can be incredibly useful for a variety of\nreasons, including:\n1. Enhanced Type Safety: By specifying allowed subclasses, you\nprevent unexpected or unwanted extensions that could break your\ncode or introduce security vulnerabilities.\n2. Improved Library Design: You can create closed ecosystems\nwithin your libraries, ensuring users only work with approved\nextensions and don’t create incompatible implementations.\n3. Easier Code Maintenance: Knowing the exact set of possible\nsubclasses simplifies reasoning about your code and makes it easier\nto understand and maintain.",

    "question": "is it possible or\nnot?",
    "answer": "Yes, it is possible to persist data directly from a Kafka topic. There\nare a few ways to do this, depending on your use case and\nrequirements.\nOne way to persist data from a Kafka topic is to use a Kafka\nconsumer to read data from the topic and write it to a database or\nfile system. This can be done using a Kafka consumer application\nthat reads data from the topic and writes it to a file or database.\nAnother way to persist data from a Kafka topic is to use Kafka\nConnect, which is a framework for streaming data between Kafka\nand other data systems. Kafka Connect can be used to move data\nfrom a Kafka topic to a database or other storage system, and can\nalso be used to move data from a database or other storage system\nto a Kafka topic.\nKafka Connect provides pre-built connectors for popular data storage\nsystems like HDFS, Amazon S3, and Elasticsearch, as well as\nconnectors for JDBC-compliant databases. Kafka Connect can be\nconfigured to read data from a Kafka topic and write it to a database\nor other storage system in real-time, providing a way to persist data\nfrom Kafka directly to storage.\nAdditionally, some databases have their own Kafka connectors that\nallow you to persist data directly to the database from a Kafka topic.\nFor example, Confluent provides a Kafka connector for PostgreSQL\nthat can be used to write data from Kafka to a PostgreSQL database.\nIn summary, it is possible to persist data directly from a Kafka topic\nusing a Kafka consumer, Kafka Connect, or a database-specific Kafka\nconnector.

  {
    "question": "some time, then can it continue consuming the messages?",
    "answer": "In Kafka, an offset is a unique identifier that represents the position\nof a consumer within a partition of a topic. The offset is used to\ntrack the progress of a consumer, allowing it to continue reading\nmessages from where it left off, even if it fails or crashes.\nWhen a consumer reads messages from a Kafka topic, it keeps track\nof the last offset it has consumed for each partition it is subscribed\nto. This offset is periodically committed to a special topic called the\n\"consumer_offsets\" topic, which is used to persist the offset\ninformation for all consumer groups.\nIf a consumer fails or crashes, and then comes alive after some\ntime, it can continue consuming messages from the last committed\noffset for each partition it is subscribed to. When the consumer\nrestarts, it retrieves the last committed offset for each partition from\nthe \"__consumer_offsets\" topic and starts consuming messages\nfrom that point.\nKafka provides two types of offset management: automatic and\nmanual. With automatic offset management, the consumer's offset is\nautomatically committed to the \"__consumer_offsets\" topic at\nregular intervals, or when a batch of messages has been processed.\nWith manual offset management, the consumer is responsible for\nexplicitly committing the offset after processing a batch of\nmessages.\nIn summary, offsets are used in Kafka to track the progress of a\nconsumer and allow it to continue reading messages from where it\nleft off, even if it fails or crashes.

    "question": "What is consumer offset?",
    "answer": "In Kafka, the \"consumer_offsets\" topic is a special internal topic that\nis used to store the committed offsets of a consumer group. The\nconsumer group is a group of one or more consumers that work\ntogether to consume messages from one or more partitions of a\ntopic.\nEach consumer in a consumer group keeps track of its own offset,\nwhich represents the position of the last message it has processed in\neach partition it is consuming. These offsets are periodically\ncommitted to the \"consumer_offsets\" topic, which serves as a\ncentralized store for the committed offsets of all consumers in the\ngroup.\nBy using the \"consumer_offsets\" topic, Kafka enables consumers to\nresume reading from their last known offset, even if they have been\nrestarted, moved to a different machine, or joined/removed from the\nconsumer group. This provides fault tolerance and scalability,\nallowing consumers to consume messages in parallel and distribute\nthe load across multiple machines.\nThe \"consumer_offsets\" topic is managed by the Kafka broker and is\nreplicated across all brokers in the cluster to ensure availability and\nreliability. It is also subject to retention policies and cleanup rules,\nwhich determine how long the offset information should be retained\nand when it should be deleted.\nIn summary, the \"consumer_offsets\" topic in Kafka is a special\ninternal topic that stores the committed offsets of a consumer group.\nIt enables consumers to resume reading from their last known\noffset, provides fault tolerance and scalability, and is managed by\nthe Kafka broker.",

    "question": "How to configure the Kafka details?",
    "answer": "Configuring Kafka involves setting up various components and\nparameters, such as broker settings, topic settings, producer\nsettings, and consumer settings. Here are some of the steps to\nconfigure Kafka:\nInstall Kafka: First, you need to download and install Kafka. You can\ndownload Kafka from the Apache Kafka website or from a cloud\nprovider like Confluent or Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nStart ZooKeeper: Kafka uses Apache ZooKeeper to manage the\nbrokers and the distributed state of the cluster. You need to start\nZooKeeper first before starting Kafka. You can start ZooKeeper using\nthe command bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh\nconfig/zookeeper.properties.\nConfigure Kafka broker settings: The broker is the main component\nof Kafka that stores and manages messages in the topics. You need\nto configure various settings for the broker, such as the broker ID,\nport, log directories, and replication factors. The broker settings are\ndefined in the config/server.properties file.\nCreate a Kafka topic: A Kafka topic is a category or feed name to\nwhich messages are published. You need to create a topic before\nproducing and consuming messages. You can create a topic using\nthe bin/kafka-topics.sh script.\nConfigure Kafka producer settings: The producer is the component\nthat produces messages to Kafka topics. You can configure various\nsettings for the producer, such as the topic name, compression type,\nand batch size. The producer settings are defined in the producer\ncode or in a configuration file.\nConfigure Kafka consumer settings: The consumer is the component\nthat consumes messages from Kafka topics. You can configure\nvarious settings for the consumer, such as the topic name, group ID,\nauto commit interval, and offset reset policy. The consumer settings\nare defined in the consumer code or in a configuration file.\nStart Kafka: Once you have configured the necessary components\nand parameters, you can start Kafka using the command bin/kafka-\nserver-start.sh config/server.properties.\nThese are the basic steps to configure Kafka.

    "question": "How to determine the replication factor?",
    "answer": "The replication factor is an important configuration parameter in\nKafka that determines how many copies of each partition should be\nmaintained across the brokers in a Kafka cluster. Choosing the right\nreplication factor is critical for ensuring data availability and fault\ntolerance in the event of a broker failure or network outage.\nHere are some guidelines for determining the appropriate replication\nfactor for your Kafka deployment:\nConsider the number of available brokers: The replication factor\nshould not exceed the number of available brokers in your Kafka\ncluster. For example, if you have three brokers, you can set the\nreplication factor to 2 or 3, but not 4.\nConsider the desired level of fault tolerance: A higher replication\nfactor provides greater fault tolerance and availability, but also\nincreases the amount of storage and network traffic required to\nmaintain the replicas. You should balance the desired level of fault\ntolerance with the cost and complexity of maintaining additional\nreplicas.\nConsider the throughput and latency requirements: A higher\nreplication factor can also impact the throughput and latency of your\nKafka cluster. Additional replicas can increase the network traffic and\nintroduce additional processing overhead, which can affect the\nperformance of the cluster.\nConsider the retention period of data: If you need to retain data for\na long period of time, you may want to increase the replication\nfactor to ensure that the data is not lost in the event of a broker\nfailure or network outage.\nIn general, a replication factor of 2 or 3 is recommended for most\nKafka deployments. This provides a good balance between fault\ntolerance, storage requirements, and performance. However, you\nshould adjust the replication factor based on your specific\nrequirements and the characteristics of your Kafka cluster.",

Containers share\nthe same operating system kernel and are isolated from other\ncontainers and the host operating system. Containers provide a\nconsistent and reproducible way to deploy and run applications,\nwhile also allowing for efficient resource usage and fast start-up\ntimes.\nIn contrast, a virtual machine is a complete operating system and\nhardware abstraction that runs on top of a hypervisor. VMs have\ntheir own virtualized hardware, such as CPU, memory, storage, and\nnetwork interfaces, and they can run their own operating system\nand applications. VMs provide strong isolation and security, as each\nVM runs independently of the host operating system and other VMs.\nHowever, this also means that they require more resources and have\nslower startup times.\nHere are some key differences between containers and virtual\nmachines:\nOverhead: Containers have lower overhead, as they share the same\noperating system kernel and can be deployed more efficiently. VMs\nhave higher overhead, as they require a full operating system and\nvirtualized hardware.\nResource usage: Containers are more efficient in their use of\nresources; as multiple containers can run on the same operating\nsystem kernel.

This allows multiple VMs to run\non a single physical server, each with its own operating system and\nresources. Each VM can host its own applications and dependencies,\nand these are isolated from the host operating system and other\nVMs on the same physical server.\nDockerization, on the other hand, involves running applications in\ncontainers, which are lightweight and portable environments that\nshare the host operating system kernel. Containers allow developers\nto package an application and its dependencies into a single unit\nthat can run on any machine that has Docker installed. Each\ncontainer is isolated from other containers and from the host\noperating system, but they all share the same kernel.\nHere are some key differences between Dockerization and\nVirtualization:\nOverhead: Virtualization requires more overhead, as it runs a\ncomplete operating system on top of the hypervisor.

They are often used in\ncomputer science applications such as database indexing, file system\norganization, and network routing algorithms.\nInserting a new value into a binary search tree involves traversing\nthe tree from the root node to a leaf node, comparing the value to\nbe inserted with the value of each node along the way, and choosing\nthe appropriate child node to continue the traversal. Searching for a\nvalue in a binary search tree follows a similar process, starting at the\nroot node and traversing the tree until the desired value is found or\nit is determined that the value is not in the tree.\nThe efficiency of binary search trees is determined by their height,\nor the number of levels in the tree. A well-balanced binary search\ntree has a height of log(n), where n is the number of nodes in the\ntree. This allows for efficient searching and insertion operations, as\nthe number of nodes that need to be visited is minimized.

If no navigation is performed (for example, when\nvalidation fails), the initial view is refreshed.\n<!-- newPerson-flow.xml -->\n<flow ...>\n<view-state id=\"enterPersonInfo\">\n<transition on=\"proceed\" to=\"reviewPerson\" />\n</view-state>\n<view-state id=\"reviewPerson\">\n<transition on=\"confirm\" to=\"enterIdentityCard\"/>\n</view-state>\n...\n</flow>\n275\nChapter 7 ■ Spring Web FloW\nWhen performing typical web navigations, there is always a Cancel button that allows the user to cancel\nthe whole process. When using Spring Web Flow, this can be done by declaring a <global-transition>\nelement, but using global transition elements sort of breaks the flow. It’s similar to using a goto statement.\nIt also makes the flow definition less readable.3\n<flow ...>\n<global-transition on=\"cancel\" to=\"cancelled\" />\n...\n</flow>\nA flow can have one or multiple end-states defined (<end-state> elements are used to define them)\nand a flow execution can end in any of them, based on the events the user triggers. After a flow execution\nreaches an end state, the flow terminates and the outcome is returned, unless the end state sends a final\nresponse or redirects the user to another resource, typically a confirmation page.\n<flow ...>\n<end-state id=\"end\" />\n</flow>\nRedirecting to a confirmation page after a flow has finished the execution is tricky, as the flow data is\ngone. The solution is to use a redirect to a stateless confirmation page and to use a parameter that has a\nvalue that can be used to display confirmation data. The <end-state> element has a view attribute that can\nbe used to specify the URL to redirect to.\n<flow ...>\n<end-state id=\"finish\"\nview=\"externalRedirect:contextRelative:/person/1\" />\n</flow>\n■ ! the value is hard-coded id value (“1”) in the previous example only because the concept that could be\nused to make that link dynamic— flow variable—has not been covered yet.\nThe contextRelative prefix is one of the explicit redirects supported in the context of a flow execution.\nWithout these prefixes, the returned resource location is relative to the current servlet mapping. The flow\nredirect prefixes help you have more control over where the user is redirected. The following is the complete\nlist of flow redirection prefixes:\n• servletRelative: Redirects to a resource relative to the current server\n• contextRelative: Redirects to a resource relative to the current web application\ncontext path\n• serverRelative: Redirects to a resource relative to the server root\n• http:// or https:// Redirects to a fully qualified resource URI\n3The GOTO statement (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goto).\n276\nChapter 7 ■ Spring Web FloW\nThese redirect prefixes are supported in a flow definition together with the externalRedirect: directive\nin view-state or end-state elements. The view-state element has a view property that can be used to\nspecify a different view than the one with the same state id, and this view can be outside the newPerson flow\ndirectory:\n<flow ...>\n<view-state id=\"reviewPerson\"\nview=\"externalRedirect:contextRelative:/verifyPerson\">\n<transition on=\"confirm\" to=\"enterIdentityCard\"/>\n</view-state>\n</flow>\nA flow can also redirect to a different flow by using the flowRedirect: directive in its end state; this\nbasically means the current flow ends and a new one is started.\nIn conclusion, when creating a web flow, it is recommended that the following steps be followed in this\norder:",

    "question": "But how does the Spring container know which dependencies are required?",
    "answer": "There\nare a few ways. One is the type of injection. Spring supports two types of injection: via constructor and\nvia setter. The constructor injection is when the constructor of a bean is defined as having an argument\nof type another bean. In the previous example, the PersonManagerImpl constructor definition requires\na PersonRepository instance as an argument, and thus the PersonManagerImpl requires a bean of type\nPersonRepository to be created before its creation.\n<!– Constructor injection –>\n<bean id=\"personManager\" class=\"com.book.PersonManagerImpl\">\n<constructor-arg ref=\"personRepository\" />\n</bean>\n<!– Setter injection–>\n<bean id=\"personRepository\" class=\"com.book.JdbcPersonRepository\">\n<property name=\"dataSource\" ref=\"dataSource\" />\n</bean>\n28\nChapter 2 ■ Spring FundamentalS\nAny object that has a constructor with arguments cannot be constructed without passing in arguments.\nThis restriction does not apply for the setter injection, but it can be enforced in two ways:\n• By annotating the setter method with @Required. If the property is not set, a\nBeanInitializationException is thrown.\n• By annotating the setter method with @Autowire the Spring IoC container\ntries to inject a bean with the specific type. If such a bean is not found, a\nBeanCreationException is thrown.\nOne of the advantages of using the setter injection is that you can create hierarchical beans,\nand setters will be inherited. In a setter injection, bean creation and dependency injection are two\nseparate steps; for constructor injection there is only one step. So basically, setter injection makes your\nconfiguration more flexible.\nFor a bean to “come to life” and become available to be used for a purpose, it has to go through the steps\nshown in Figure 2-5.\nFigure 2-5. The steps for a bean creation\n29\nChapter 2 ■ Spring FundamentalS\nHow Bean Factory Post Processors Work\nA bean definition can be modified before instantiating the bean, and this is done by beans called bean\nfactory post processors. They are defined as classes implementing the BeanFactoryPostProcessor interface\nand are recognized by an application context and instantiated before any other beans in the container.\nThe most used and known in the Spring world is the PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer.\n<bean id=\"dataSource\" class=\n\"o.s.jdbc.datasource.DriverManagerDataSource\">\n<property name=\"driverClassName\" value=\"${driverClassName}\"/>\n<property name=\"url\" value=\"${url}\"/>\n<property name=\"username\" value=\"${username}\"/>\n<property name=\"password\" value=\"${password}\"/>\n</bean>\n<context:property-placeholder location=\"classpath:datasource/db.properties\"/>\nThe last line in this example is a simplified version of defining a PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer using\nthe Spring context namespace; it is equivalent to the following:\n<bean class=\n\"o.s.beans.factory.config.PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer\">\n<property name=\"location\" value=\"classpath:datasource/db.properties\"/>\n</bean>\nThis bean reads those properties from the db.properties file and then populates the dataSource\nsource bean with their values. Of course, the easier way to do this is to use SpEL expressions and the util\nnamespace:\n<util:properties id=\"dbProp\" location=\"classpath:datasource/db.properties\"/>\n<bean id=\"dataSource\" class=\n\"o.s.jdbc.datasource.DriverManagerDataSource\">\n<property name=\"driverClassName\" value=\"#{dbProp.driverClassName}\"/>\n<property name=\"url\" value=\"#{dbProp.url}\"/>\n<property name=\"username\" value=\"#{dbProp.username}\"/>\n<property name=\"password\" value=\"#{dbProp.password}\"/>\n</bean>\nBean Initialization and Destruction\nAn ApplicationContext instantiates all singleton (bean scopes are covered in detail in the “Bean Scopes”\nsection) beans by default and also destroys them at the end of their lives. After a bean has been created and\nits dependencies injected, it can be initialized automatically by telling the context to execute a specified\nmethod. Before a bean ends its life, a different method might be called to do some resource cleanup. The\ncontext can be told to automatically do that too. These methods must have a void no-argument signature.\nThere is no restriction on the accessor used for them. In the official documentation, the lifecycle methods\ngiven as example are all public. But there are opinions that state they should be protected or private\n(obviously, it does not apply to InitializingBean’s afterPropertiesSet and DisposableBean’s destroy)\nto prevent direct calls of these methods from the application code, as these methods should be called only\nonce and only by the Spring IoC container.\n30\nChapter 2 ■ Spring FundamentalS\nThere are multiple options for bean initialization:\n• Using @PostConstruct from JSR 250\n• Using @Bean’s initMethod attribute\n• Implementing InitializingBean and providing implementation for the\nafterPropertiesSet method (not recommended because it couples the application\ncode with Spring infrastructure code)\n• Using the init-method attribute on a <bean/> XML definition\nWhen a bean ends its life, some cleanup operations might be necessary; to implement this kind of\nbehavior, there are also multiple options:\n• Using @PreDestroy from JSR 250\n• Using @Bean’s destroyMethod attribute\n• Implementing DisposableBean and providing implementation for the destroy\nmethod (not recommended, as it couples the application code with Spring\ninfrastructure code)\n• Using the destroy-method attribute on a <bean/> XML definition\nIn the code sample there is a bean in the com.book.spring.components package that was implemented\nin such a way to clarify the Spring bean lifecycle. The bean is called CompleteLivingBean and has\n@PostConstruct and @PreDestroy annotated methods, implements InitializingBean and\nDisposableBean, and has methods in which names are used as values for attributes init-method and\ndestroy-method. This bean was implemented using a combined lifecycle strategy to clearly show when each\ninitializer/destruction method is called by the Spring IoC and to clearly display the bean creation steps in\nFigure 2-5.\nThis is the configuration:\n<context:component-scan base-package=\"com.book.beans\"/>\n<bean id=\"livingBean\" class=\"com.book.beans.CompleteLivingBean\"\ninit-method=\"initMethod\"\ndestroy-method=\"destroyMethod\">\n<property name=\"internal\" value=\"testValue\"/>\n</bean>\nThis is the definition of the bean class:\npublic class CompleteLivingBean implements InitializingBean, DisposableBean {\npublic String internal;\npublic CompleteLivingBean() {\nlogger.info(\"1. Constructor.\");\n}\npublic void setInternal(String internal) {\nlogger.info(\"2. Setter.\");\nthis.internal = internal;\n}\n31\nChapter 2 ■ Spring FundamentalS\n@PostConstruct\npublic void postConstruct(){\nlogger.info(\"3. @PostConstruct.\");\n}\n@Override\npublic void afterPropertiesSet() throws Exception {\nlogger.info(\"4. afterPropertiesSet.\");\n}\npublic void initMethod(){\nlogger.info(\"5. init-method.\");\n}\n@PreDestroy\npublic void preDestroy(){\nlogger.info(\"6. PreDestroy.\");\n}\n@Override\npublic void destroy() throws Exception {\nlogger.info(\"7. destroy.\");\n}\npublic void destroyMethod() throws Exception {\nlogger.info(\"8. destroy-method.\");\n}\n}\nAlso, there is no restriction on method names used as values for init-method and destroy-method\nattributes; initMethod and destroyMethod were used in this example to make their purpose really obvious.\n■ ! in the certification exam, you might be asked which method is executed first—the one annotated with\n@PostConstruct or the one mentioned by the init-method; so the CompleteLivingBean helps clear up when\nmethods are executed and why.\nWhen executing the test for the com.book.beans.BeanLifecycleTest bean, you will see the\nfollowing output:\nINFO c.b.b.CompleteLivingBean - 1. Constructor.\nINFO c.b.b.CompleteLivingBean - 2. Setter.\nINFO c.b.b.CompleteLivingBean - 3. @PostConstruct.\nINFO c.b.b.CompleteLivingBean - 4. afterPropertiesSet.\n32\nChapter 2 ■ Spring FundamentalS\nINFO c.b.b.CompleteLivingBean - 5. init-method.\n...\nINFO c.b.b.CompleteLivingBean - 6. @PreDestroy.\nINFO c.b.b.CompleteLivingBean - 7. destroy.\nINFO c.b.b.CompleteLivingBean - 8. destroy-method.\nAs represented in Figure 2-5, when a bean is created, the following succession of actions happens:\n1. The constructor is called first to create the bean.\n2. The dependencies are injected (setters are called).\n3. The pre-initialization BeanPostProcessors are consulted to see if they want to\ncall anything from this bean. The @PostConstruct annotation is registered by\nthe CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor, so this bean will call this annotated\nmethod. This method is executed right after the bean has been constructed and\nbefore the class is put into service,6 before the actual initialization of the bean\n(before afterPropertiesSet and init-method).\n4. The InitializingBean’s afterPropertiesSet is executed right after the\ndependencies were injected.\n5. The init-method attribute value method is executed last, as this is the actual\ninitialization method of the bean.\nWhen a bean is destroyed:\n1. The @PreDestroy method is executed, as this has to be executed before a destroy\nmethod, if one exists. The PreDestroy annotation is used on methods as a\ncallback notification to signal that the instance is in the process of being removed\nby the container.7\n2. The DisposableBean’s destroy method is executed next, as the Spring standard\norder defines it so.\n3. The destroy-method attribute value method is executed last, as this is the actual\ndestroy method of the bean, and the Spring standard order defines it so.\nThis is the simplified and more natural explanation of the bean lifecycle; in most cases, this is all you\nwill need. If you want to view the full picture with full plumbing details and other things the context does,\nyou can read the official JEE and Spring documentation.8\n■ ! the main reason for init-method and destroy-method creation was to give the developer a little\ncontrol over beans definitions from third-party libraries, which have classes that cannot be modified or\nextended. this way, the developer can decide what gets executed after creation and what executes before\ndestruction by using Xml configuration.\n6A snippet from the JEE official Java doc at http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/annotation/\nPostConstruct.html.\n7A snippet from the JEE official Java doc at http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/annotation/\nPreDestroy.html.\n8http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/\nBeanFactory.html.\n33\nChapter 2 ■ Spring FundamentalS\nHow Bean Post Processors Work\nA BeanPostProcessor allows the developer to process a bean instance created by the IoC container after its\ninstantiation, and then again after the initialization lifecycle event has occurred on it. BeanPostProcessors\nare defined as classes implementing the BeanPostProcessor interface, and are recognized by an application\ncontext and instantiated before any other beans in the container, because after their instantiation, they are\nused to manipulate other beans instantiated by the IoC container. The @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy\nannotations are processed by a bean called CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor. This is not a default\ninfrastructure bean for the Spring IoC container, so to use it you have to specify it in the configuration of the\napplication. You would expect to need something like this in the mvc-config.xml file:\n<bean class=\"o.s.c.a.CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor\"/>\nAnd this could work, but there will be some issues because configuring the bean like that overrides the\nSpring defaults, which might lead to unexpected behavior. Fortunately, this bean configuration is one of\nthose included in the following line, a Spring shortcut based on the context namespace:\n<context:component-scan base-package=\"com.book.beans\"/>\nOr in this one:\n<context:annotation-config/>\nThe BeanPostProcessor beans wrap other beans into AOP proxies that add extra behavior (more details\non AOP in the “Spring AOP” section). The Spring Framework has different types of BeanPostProcessors\nthat can be used for caching, transactions, security, and so forth. The CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor\nscans for methods annotated with @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy, and calls those methods at the\nappropriate time.\nThe code samples use logback to display logs. By increasing the granularity of the log for\nthe Spring Framework to DEBUG, you can see what is happening “behind the scenes,” and what\nCommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor is actually doing. In the following configuration snippet, you are\nshown how to modify the granularity of the log by editing the logger element for the Spring Framework in\nthe logback.xml file:\n<logger name=\"org.springframework\" level=\"DEBUG\" additivity=\"false\">\n<appender-ref ref=\"STDOUT\" />\n</logger>\nAfter modifying the log file when running the BeanLifecycleTest, you can see the behavior of the\nCommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor9:\nINFO CompleteLivingBean - 1. Constructor.\nDEBUG CABPP - Found init method on class\nCompleteLivingBean: private void CompleteLivingBean.postConstruct()\nDEBUG CABPP Found destroy method on class\nCompleteLivingBean: protected void CompleteLivingBean.preDestroy()\n9CABPP is the acronym for CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor. It is used to fit a log quote nicely on a page.\n34\nChapter 2 ■ Spring FundamentalS\nDEBUG CABPP Registered init method on class CompleteLivingBean:\nInitDestroyAnnotationBeanPostProcessor$LifecycleElement@64e17f36\nDEBUG CABPP Registered destroy method on class CompleteLivingBean:\nDestroyAnnotationBeanPostProcessor$LifecycleElement@a27dd7d7\nINFO c.b.b.CompleteLivingBean - 2. Setter.\nDEBUG CABPP - Invoking init method on bean ’livingBean’:\nprivate void CompleteLivingBean.postConstruct()\nINFO c.b.b.CompleteLivingBean - 3. @PostConstruct.\nINFO c.b.b.CompleteLivingBean - 4. afterPropertiesSet.\n...\nDEBUG CABPP - Invoking destroy method on bean ’livingBean’:\nprotected void CompleteLivingBean.preDestroy()\nINFO c.b.b.CompleteLivingBean - 1. @PreDestroy.\nThe previous section mentioned that there are annotation attributes equivalents for the init-method and\ndestroy-method. If you were to define CompleteLivingBean using a class annotated with @Configuration,\nit would look like this:\n@Bean(initMethod = \"initMethod\", destroyMethod = \"destroyMethod\")\npublic CompleteLivingBean getCompleteLivingBean() {\nreturn new CompleteLivingBean();\n}\nAnd would be equivalent to this XML definition:\n<bean id=\"livingBean\" class=\"com.book.beans.CompleteLivingBean\"\ninit-method=\"initMethod\" destroy-method=\"destroyMethod\"/>\nBean Scopes\nWhen the Spring IoC instantiates beans, it creates a single instance for each bean—unless a property is set\non the bean definition specifying otherwise. The property in question is called scope and the default scope\nfor a bean is singleton. The scopes are defined in Table 2-2.\nTable 2-2. Bean Scopes\nScope Description\nsingleton The Spring IoC creates a single instance of this bean and any request for beans with\nan id or ids matching this bean definition results in this instance being returned.\nprototype Every time a request is made for this specific bean, the Spring IoC creates\na new instance.\nrequest The Spring IoC creates a bean instance for each HTTP request. Only valid in the\ncontext of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.\nsession The Spring IoC creates a bean instance for each HTTP session. Only valid in the\ncontext of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.\nglobal-session The Spring IoC creates a bean instance for each global HTTP session. Only valid in\nthe context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.\n35\nChapter 2 ■ Spring FundamentalS\nSo when a bean is created without a scope attribute, the scope of the bean is singleton:\n<bean id=\"personRepository\" class=\"com.book.JdbcPersonRepository\">\n<property name=\"dataSource\" ref=\"dataSource\"/>\n</bean>\nOtherwise, the scope of the bean is the one specified by the value of the scope attribute:\n<bean id=\"personRepository\" class=\"com.book.JdbcPersonRepository\"\nscope=\"prototype\">\n<property name=\"dataSource\" ref=\"dataSource\"/>\n</bean>\nThere is an annotation equivalent to this that can be used on @Component (and other stereotype\nannotations) annotated beans:\n@Component\n@Scope(value = ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)\npublic class PrototypeBean {\nprivate Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(PrototypeBean.class);\nprivate static int instanceCounter = 0;\npublic PrototypeBean() {\nlogger.info(\"-> Constructing instance no: \" + (++instanceCounter));\n}\n}\n■ ! @Scope(value = ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE) is equivalent to\n@Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE) and @Scope(\"prototype\") because constant\nSCOPE_PROTOTYPE is of type string and has the \"prototype\" value. using Spring constants eliminates the\nrisk of misspelling the scope value.\nThe @Scope annotation can also be used on a bean definition annotated with @Bean to specify the scope\nof the resulting bean.\n@Bean(name=\"personManager\")\n@Scope(\"prototype\")\n//or @Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)\npublic PrototypeBean getPrototypeBean(){\nreturn new PrototypeBean();\n}\n36\nChapter 2 ■ Spring FundamentalS\nIf you were to execute the following test, the test would pass:\n@Test\npublic void testPrototype() {\n// Create the application from the configuration\nClassPathXmlApplicationContext context =\nnew ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(\"classpath:test-app-config.xml\");\nPrototypeBean pb1 = (PrototypeBean)context.getBean(\"prototypeBean\");\nassertNotNull(pb1);\n//the bean is requested by type\nPrototypeBean pb2 = context.getBean(PrototypeBean.class);\nassertNotNull(pb2);\nassertNotEquals(pb1,pb2);\n}\nAnd this is what would be seen in the log file:\nDEBUG - Creating instance of bean 'prototypeBean'\nINFO -> Constructing instance no: 1\nDEBUG - Finished creating instance of bean 'prototypeBean'\nDEBUG - Creating instance of bean 'prototypeBean'\nINFO -> Constructing instance no: 2\nDEBUG - Finished creating instance of bean 'prototypeBean'\nA special case of bean scope is the scope of an inner bean. An inner bean is defined within the scope\nof another bean. The reason for doing this is because the bean does not need to be shared with other\nbeans, but is needed only for the creation of the enclosing bean. The scope attribute has no meaning for an\ninner bean and is ignored; so are the attributes id and name, as the bean is anonymous. When using Java\nConfiguration, the inner bean is just a local variable in a method. The following code snipped declares the\nDataSource bean as an inner bean:\n<util:properties id=\"dbProp\" location=\"classpath:datasource/db.properties\"/>\n<bean id=\"personRepository\" class=\"com.book.JdbcPersonRepository\">\n<property name=\"dataSource\">\n<bean id=\"dataSource\" class=\n\"org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DriverManagerDataSource\">\n<property name=\"driverClassName\" value=\"#{dbProp.driverClassName}\"/>\n<property name=\"url\" value=\"#{dbProp.url}\"/>\n<property name=\"username\" value=\"#{dbProp.username}\"/>\n<property name=\"password\" value=\"#{dbProp.password}\"/>\n</bean>\n</property>\n</bean>\n37\nChapter 2 ■ Spring FundamentalS\nAccessing Beans\nBeans can be identified in three ways: by type, by name, and by id. The following subsections explain\nthese in detail; examples are provided for each case. How to access beans configured with annotates is\ncovered too.\nBean Identification by Type\nA bean can be identified by its type if there is only one definition of a bean with that type in the Spring\nconfiguration file.\nThe BeanPostPrecessor classes registered by <context:annotation-config/> that scan for\nannotations are singleton infrastructure beans instantiated by the Spring IoC container, when that\nconfiguration line is present in a Spring configuration file. At any time during the life of an application only\none instance of each of those beans will exist. Basically, this configuration file:\n<beans xmlns=\"http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans\"\nxmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\nxmlns:context=\"http://www.springframework.org/schema/context\"\nxsi:schemaLocation=\"\nhttp://www.springframework.org/schema/beans\nhttp://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd\nhttp://www.springframework.org/schema/context\nhttp://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context.xsd\">\n<context:annotation-config/>\n</beans>",

    "question": "You can easily notice which lines from XML turned into which lines in the code, right?",
    "answer": "But there is another way, which involves constructing the application context first and then injecting\nit into the DispatcherServlet:\nXmlWebApplicationContext appContext = new XmlWebApplicationContext();\nappContext.setConfigLocation(\"/WEB-INF/spring/mvc-config.xml\");\nServletRegistration.Dynamic registration =\nservletContext.addServlet(\"dispatcher\", new DispatcherServlet(appContext));\nregistration.setLoadOnStartup(1);\nregistration.addMapping(\"/\");\nAnd there is an even simpler way—by extending AbstractDispatcherServletInitializer, an abstract\nimplementation of the WebApplicationInitializer:\npublic class WebInitializer extends AbstractDispatcherServletInitializer {\n@Override\nprotected WebApplicationContext createRootApplicationContext() {\n//there is no root application context for the web application context to inherit\nreturn null;\n}\n@Override\nprotected WebApplicationContext createServletApplicationContext() {\nXmlWebApplicationContext cxt = new XmlWebApplicationContext();\ncxt.setConfigLocation(\"/WEB-INF/spring/mvc-config.xml\");\nreturn cxt;\n}\n@Override\nprotected String getServletMappings() {\nreturn new String { \"/\" };\n}\n}\n65\nChapter 3 ■ Spring MVC\nJava-based annotation configurations are supported too—in multiple ways. Consider that you have a\nWebConfig class and a web.xml that looks like this:\n<servlet>\n<servlet-name>admin</servlet-name>\n<servlet-class>\no.s.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet\n</servlet-class>\n<init-param>\n<param-name>contextClass</param-name>\n<param-value>\no.s.web.context.AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext\n</param-value>\n</init-param>\n<init-param>\n<param-name>contextConfigLocation</param-name>\n<param-value>\ncom.book.config.WebConfig\n</param-value>\n</init-param>\n<load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>\n</servlet>\n<servlet-mapping>\n<servlet-name>admin</servlet-name>\n<url-pattern>/</url-pattern>\n</servlet-mapping>\nThis is the most obvious way to implement WebApplicationInitializer’s onStartup() method:\nServletRegistration.Dynamic registration =\nservletContext.addServlet(\"dispatcher\", new DispatcherServlet());\nregistration.setLoadOnStartup(1);\nregistration.addMapping(\"/\");\nregistration.setInitParameter(\"contextConfigLocation\", \"com.book.config.WebConfig\");\nregistration.setInitParameter(\"contextClass\",\n\"o.s.w.c.s.AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext\");\nBut wait, there’s more! You can create the application context and inject it into the DispatcherServlet\nas you did before:\nAnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext context =\nnew AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext();\ncontext.register(WebConfig.class);\nServletRegistration.Dynamic registration =\nservletContext.addServlet(\"dispatcher\", new DispatcherServlet(context));\nregistration.setLoadOnStartup(1);\nregistration.addMapping(\"/\");\n66\nChapter 3 ■ Spring MVC\nAnd the easiest way to do it is with AbstractAnnotationConfigDispatcherServletInitializer,\nwhich extends AbstractDispatcherServletInitializer, an abstract implementation of the\nWebApplicationInitializer. Spring provides them to help you eliminate some of the code writing.\nBy extending the AbstractAnnotationConfigDispatcherServletInitializer template and using\ncustomization methods offered by the AbstractDispatcherServletInitializer, the developer\nis only required to provide concrete implementations for three methods: getRootConfigClasses,\ngetServletConfigClasses, and getServletMappings.",

    "answer": "HospitalFormatter is a custom formatter specifically created to be used in projects attached to this\nbook. It basically transforms a Hospital instance into its name so that it can be rendered in a view. And it\ntakes a hospital id and retrieves the Hospital instance from the database to be returned to the controller,\nwhere it is used further. As the HospitalFormatter is a bean like any other, the HospitalManager bean can\nbe injected into it to make this happen. So the custom implementation looks like this:\npublic class HospitalFormatter implements Formatter<Hospital> {\n@Autowired\nHospitalManager hospitalManager;\n@Override\npublic Hospital parse(String text, Locale locale)\nthrows ParseException {\nLong id = Long.parseLong(text);\nreturn hospitalManager.findOne(id);\n}\n@Override\npublic String print(Hospital hospital, Locale locale) {\nreturn hospital.getName();\n}\n}\n128\nChapter 3 ■ Spring MVC\nData Binding\nForm objects, data transfer objects, and domain objects have been mentioned so far.

    "confidence": 1.0
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Spring MVC know how to do this?",
    "answer": "The answer to these three questions is a\nprocess named data binding.\nSpring MVC binds the request to the form object. When a form is submitted, string data is transformed\ninto objects that are injected into the form object using getters and setters. A POST request or form\nsubmission means setters for the form model attribute are called. A GET or page/form load means getters\nare called upon the form model attribute to populate the view. Each object is identified using the path\nattribute value in the corresponding Spring element tag. The form object it tightly bound to the JSP page,\nand if the form object cannot be created, the JSP page won’t be rendered correctly. The form object is linked\nto the JSP page using the modelAttribute attribute in the <sf:form/> tag:\n<sf:form modelAttribute=\"person\" action=\"${editUrl}\" method=\"POST\">\n...\n</sf:form>\nIn the controller, the form object can be accessed in multiple ways. It can be received as an argument to\nthe method mapped to the ${editUrl}.\n@Controller\npublic class PersonsController {\n@RequestMapping(method=RequestMethod.POST)\npublic String update(Person person) {\n...\n}\nIn this case, data is copied automatically into the object, and the object is re-created on every request.\nYou can annotate the form object with the @ModelAttribute annotation.\n@Controller\npublic class PersonsController {\n@RequestMapping(method=RequestMethod.POST)\npublic String edit(@ModelAttribute(\"person\") Person person) {\n...\n}\n■ CC When the name of the modelAttribute is the same as the name of the argument in a handler method,\nthe value for @ModelAttribute can be skipped. So in the previous case, public String update\n(@ModelAttribute(\"person\") Person person) is equivalent to public String update(@ModelAttribute\nPerson person).\nThis annotation was mentioned in the “Redirecting” section; it can be used the same way for forms too,\nbecause in this case, you have a controller that handles the edit and show requests for a person instance.\n@ModelAttribute annotated methods are executed before the chosen @RequestMapping annotated handler\nmethod. They effectively pre-populate the implicit model with specific attributes, in this case, the person\ninstance to be displayed or edited.\n129\nChapter 3 ■ Spring MVC\nSo you can simplify the controller like this:\n@Controller\n@RequestMapping(\"/persons/{id}\")\npublic class PersonsController {\n@ModelAttribute\npublic Person findPerson(@PathVariable Long id) {\nreturn personManager.findOne(id);\n}\n@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET)\npublic String show() {\nreturn \"persons/show\";\n}\n@RequestMapping(value=\"/edit\", method = RequestMethod.GET)\npublic String edit(Model model) {\n//we add the hospitalList to show in the Hospital drop-down list\nmodel.addAttribute(hospitalRepo.findAll());\nreturn \"persons/edit\";\n}\n@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST)\npublic String save(Person person, BindingResult result, Model model) {\nif (result.hasErrors()) {\n// we need to add this here as the dropdown list\n// has to be populated correctly\n// and \"hospitalList\" is not a model attribute\nmodel.addAttribute(hospitalRepo.findAll());\nreturn \"persons/edit\";\n}\npersonManager.save(person);\nreturn \"redirect:/persons/\".concat(person.getId());\n}\n}\nIn this implementation, you do not have to concern yourself with the existence of the form object\nbecause the methods of this controller are only accessible when the URL is constructed with a valid\nperson id.\nBy default, all fields in a form are binded to the form object, but Spring MVC offers the possibility to\nmodify the default behavior by customizing a WebDataBinder object. Some fields can be blacklisted or\nwhitelisted for the binding process:\n@InitBinder\npublic void initBinder(WebDataBinder binder) {\n//allowed fields\nbinder.setAllowedFields(\"firstName\", \"lastName\");\n//disallowed fields\nbinder.setDisallowedFields(\"pk\", \"*Pk\");\n}\n130\nChapter 3 ■ Spring MVC\nThe recommended behavior is to whitelist only the necessary fields, even if there might be a lot of them\nto minimize the security holes.\nThe validation errors are binded to the form object too using a BindingResult object.\n@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST)\npublic String save(@Valid Person person, BindingResult result, Model model) {\nif (result.hasErrors()) {\nreturn \"persons/edit\";\n}\n...\n}\nIf you look at the beginning of this section, where the Edit person form code is, you see that some\nelements look like this:\n<sf:errors cssClass=\"error\" path=\"dateOfBirth\"/></td>\nThey are right next to their analogue elements:\n<sf:input path=\"dateOfBirth\"/>\nAnd they have the exact path attribute value. These elements are used to display validation errors when\nthe POST handler method returns back to the edit view because the BindingResult object was populated\nby an existing validator bean. When returning to the form, the submitted data is still there, but there is extra\ninformation about the state and condition of the submitted data, something more or less like what you see in\nFigure 3-17.\nFigure 3-17. Spring default validation errors displayed after a form failed submission\n131\nChapter 3 ■ Spring MVC\nSpring MVC has its own validator messages, but supports externally provided validator messages too.\nData binding error messages can be customized and internationalized. The following are some examples;\ndepending on the validation library used, the message keys could be different:\nNotEmpty.person.firstName=Please insert First Name Value\nSize.person.firstName=Length must be between {2} and {1}\ntypeMismatch.dateOfBirth=Invalid format, should be \\'yyyy-mm-dd\\'\ntypeMismatch.amount=Incorrect amount\nAnd after the customization, when a submit fails, the invalidated form looks like what’s shown in\nFigure 3-18.\nFigure 3-18. Customized validation errors displayed after a form failed submission\nData Validation\nSpring MVC supports JSR 303/349 Bean Validation for validating form objects. If the library javax.\nvalidation:validation-api:[version] is in the classpath and the application is configured using\n<mvc:annotation-driven/> or @EnableWebMvc, it is automatically detected and enabled.\nSpring 4+ also supports Hibernate Validator 4.3+, but for the org.hibernate:hibernate-\nvalidator:[version] library to be used, a custom validator that implements org.springframework.\nvalidation.Validator must be set in the configuration; for example:\n<!-- Enables hibernate validator -->\n<bean id=\"validator\"\nclass=\"o.s.validation.beanvalidation.LocalValidatorFactoryBean\"/>\n<!-- Defines basic MVC defaults (handler adapter, mapping,\ndate formatting, etc) -->\n<mvc:annotation-driven validator=\"validator\"/>\nThe Hibernate Validator is an extension of the default set of validation annotations provided by the\nvalidation-api library, that’s why when using Hibernate Validator, validation-api is enabled by default,\nas validation-api is a dependency of the Hibernate Validator.\n132\nChapter 3 ■ Spring MVC\n■ ! to depict this, a special gradle task was created for you in the 00-pr-dao module: allCompileDeps.\nWhen executed, gradle prints the dependency tree for the 00-pr-dao module in the intellij iDea console.\nif you analyze the output, you will find the following snippet.\n+--- org.hibernate:hibernate-validator:5.1.3.Final\n| +--- javax.validation:validation-api:1.1.0.Final\n| +--- org.jboss.logging:jboss-logging:3.1.3.GA\n| \\--- com.fasterxml:classmate:1.0.0\nThe following are examples of validation annotations:\n• @NotNull: Field cannot be null\n• @Size (min, max): File must have a length in the range (min, max)\n• @Pattern: String not null and matching\n• @NotEmpty: String must not be empty (Hibernate)\n• @Min(val), @Max(val): String must be of length at least minimum,\nor maximum in size\nThey are used on the fields of interest in the domain object or data transfer object:\npublic class Person extends AbstractEntity {\n@Size(min=2, max=50)\npublic String firstName;\n@Size(min=2, max=50)\npublic String lastName;\n@NotNull\n// comment the following if a custom formatter is registered\n@DateTimeFormat(pattern = \"yyyy-MM-dd\")\nprivate Date dateOfBirth;\n...\n}\nThe validation is invoked by annotating the form object with @Valid and the errors are registered in the\nBindingResult object too, alongside the binding errors.\nIn the JSP form, the way the errors are displayed can also be customized. In the previous section, each\nerror was mapped to its field, but you can also print all the errors in the same place by using the following\nsyntax:\n<sf:form modelAttribute=\"person\">\n<form:errors path=\"*\"/>\n...\n</sf:form>\nThis approach is not recommended for big forms. It is also quite annoying for the user to have to search\nfor the form field he has to correct. By linking the error to the form field, it becomes quite obvious where the\ncorrection must be applied.\n133\nChapter 3 ■ Spring MVC\nThe Hibernate Validator contains its own set of internationalization files with default internationalized\nmessages. The Resource bundle is named ValidationMessages; it is located in the hibernate-valdiator.jar\nunder the org.hibernate.validator package. You can expand the hibernate-validator.jar and look at it\ncontents in Intellij IDEA, as shown in Figure 3-19.\nFigure 3-19. Contents of the hibernate-validator.jar\nThe message keys in the ValidationMessages.properties files are the message keys set by default in the\ndefinition of each annotation. For example, the following is a snippet of code for the @NotEmpty annotation:\n@Constraint(validatedBy = { })\n@Target({ METHOD, FIELD, ANNOTATION_TYPE, CONSTRUCTOR, PARAMETER })\n@Retention(RUNTIME)\n@ReportAsSingleViolation\n@NotNull\n@Size(min = 1)\npublic @interface NotEmpty {\nString message() default \"{org.hibernate.validator.constraints.NotEmpty.message}\";\n...\n}\nFor every field that fails, the @NotEmpty validation has the default error message printed next to it\n(if configured so), read from the Hibernate Validator resource bundle files. These messages can be\noverridden by creating your own ValidationMessages resource bundle in the classpath of the project. Also,\nthe message keys can be customized by making the new message key a parameter for the message property\nwhen using the annotation; this allows specific messages to be displayed when the same annotation is used\non different fields:\n// in the Person entity class\n@NotEmpty(message=\"lastname.notempty\")\npublic String lastName;\n#in the ValidationMessages.properties\nlastname.notempty=Lastname cannot be empty!\n134\nChapter 3 ■ Spring MVC\nWhen using Spring forms, the error messages can be part of the application resource bundle under\nWEB-INF\\messages; the message keys usually respect the following template:\nconstraintName.modelAttributeName.propertyName\nEach part of the Spring message key is linked to elements in the application, as depicted in Figure 3-20.\nFigure 3-20. Spring message keys and linked elements\nThe message samples at the end of the previous section include customized validation messages, used\nin the 05-pr-mvc-form-practice and solution modules.\nSpring also supports the JEE @Constraint21 annotation, which can be used to define customized\nvalidation annotations.\n// Pnc.java\n@Constraint(validatedBy = [PncValidator.class])\n@Target( { ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.FIELD })\n@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)",

You'll use the 08-pr-ajax-practice project module. 08-pr-ajax-solution is\nanalogous module with a proposed solution. This module also contains extra implementations that were\nmentioned earlier in the chapter.\nThe TODO tasks for this chapter are shown in Figure 6-9.\nFigure 6-9.

Most\napplications imply creating objects and passing them through several states, or creating objects depending\non each other. Spring Web Flow (SWF) is a component of the Spring Framework’s web stack that was created\nto help develop complex applications by reducing the difficulty in development.\nThe Spring Web Flow complements the @Controller model and provides the infrastructure needed to\nbuild complex web applications that support controlled page navigation and state transition; all of this adds\nup to a rigorously defined conversation between the end user and the application. It is possible to write such\napplications with any other web technology, but the definition of a flow is interconnected with the rest of the\nweb components; it is scattered all over the implementation, which makes refactoring and maintenance a\nreal pain. What Spring Web Flow brings to the table is the possibility to define flows as separate components\ndetached from the rest of the implementation—web-specific classes and views. The flow components can\nbe defined and used similar to the way beans are used in Spring. Flow definitions can be inherited, thus\nimplementing flow hierarchies. Flows can be reused and customized as needed.\nAs this book being is written, the current version of Spring Web Flow is the 2.4.2.RELEASE,1 so this is\nthe version added as a dependency for the Web Flow chapter sources.

    "question": "What Is a Flow?",
    "answer": "A flow models the sequence of steps necessary to perform a task. The most common and simple flow\nexample is ordering items on the Internet. This operation requires the following steps in which the user\nis guided through: choose item, proceed to checkout, create an account or log in to your account, insert\nshipping detail, insert payment details, and approve payment to complete the process. Each failure to\nprovide the correct information stops the user from advancing to the next step. If the user wants to go back\nand review a previous screen, he can do so, unless configured otherwise. But there are web operations that\ndepend on the data received from the user to direct them from one flow to another.\n1The official site of the project (http://projects.spring.io/spring-webflow/) is usually updated late, so it might\nshow an earlier version; the most recent release can be found on the Maven public repositpry site at\nhttp://mvnrepository.com.\n257\nChapter 7 ■ Spring Web FloW\nBy using the Personal Records Manager at the completion of this chapter, you will be able to create\nan account and personal data for a person. This operation requires you to design a flow that executes the\nfollowing steps:\n1. Insert personal data.\n2. If the hospital where the user was born is in the system, select it.\n3. Otherwise, the user is directed to the page where he can create a Hospital\ninstance.\n4. Return to the previous step and complete creating the Person instance.\n5. Insert IdentityCard data.\n6. Review data.\n7. If the person is an adult (age > 18), add an account.\nThese steps are depicted in Figure 7-1.\nFigure 7-1. Personal Records Manager web flow\nIn Spring Web Flow, a flow consists of a series of steps called states. A flow will always have only one\nstart point and one or more end points. Leaving one state and passing into another can be restricted by the\nresult of a conditional expression. Entering a new state usually results in a view being displayed to the user.\nThe user works with the view, causing user events to occur. The user events trigger transitions between\nstates, which in turn cause navigation to another view.\n258\nChapter 7 ■ Spring Web FloW\nAside from making development easier and clearer, Spring Web Flow was created to solve the following\nproblems related to complex web navigation:\n• Duplicate submissions.\n• Pop-up window support within a flow.\n• State synchronization problems between the server and the client caused by using\nthe browser’s back and refresh buttons.\n• State collisions between windows.\n• Stale session state. (A session can end up containing inactive data, when a timeout is\nset. The inactive items must be precisely identified and purged.)\n• Short-circuiting navigation rules. (Possibility to jump over steps in the navigation,\ndepending on navigation conditions.)\nWeb Flow Architecture\nIn Spring Web Flow, flows are defined using an XML-based flow definition language. The backing\nclasses follow the model already established by Spring MVC. Spring Web Flow provides its own classes to\nidentify handler methods matching flow execution requests and resolving views. The DispatcherServlet is\nstill the front controller when the application is servlet based. For implementation with portlets, there is an\nanalogous implementation provided with DispatcherPortlet(s) as entry points. The similarities with the\nSpring MVC model can be observed in Figure 7-2.\nFigure 7-2. The Spring Web Flow backing classes\n259\nChapter 7 ■ Spring Web FloW\nThe FlowController class is the adapter between the Spring MVC Controller layer and the Spring Web\nFlow engine. Its responsibility is to provide implementation so that Spring Web Flow can run embedded as a\ncontroller within a DispatcherServlet. So basically, the FlowController is itself a front controller for Spring\nWeb Flow.\nThe FlowHandlerMapping maps all flow requests to the appropriate handlers using\nFlowDefinitionRegistry. The FlowHandlerAdapter takes care of executing the flow handler methods in a\nservlet environment using the FlowExecutor implementation.\nAfter they do their jobs, the DispatcherServlet uses the FlowViewResolver interface to resolve a view\nfrom the state of an executing flow.\nWhen working with flows, each flow definition is declared in a specific configuration file and is\nregistered in the system by the FlowDefinitionRegistry. For each flow in the system, a configuration file is\ncreated and placed in the same directory with all resources implied in the flow execution: views templates,\nproperty files, and others. In Figure 7-3, you can see how the files are organized in the practice project for\nthis chapter.\nFigure 7-3. Personal Records Manager web flow configuration file and resources\n260\nChapter 7 ■ Spring Web FloW\nThe newPerson-flow.xml configuration file contains the states that the users are directed through to\ncreate a new person. For now, the empty file is presented containing only the Spring Web Flow namespace",

    "source": "extracted",

  },
  {
    "question": "sample belongs?",
    "answer": "Explicit variables can be defined as view-scoped objects too. In this case, the variable is created when\nthe view-state is entered and is destroyed when the transition to the next view-state occurs. They can be\nused as data models for a single view. They are often updated using AJAX requests before being used for the\nexpression conditioning the transition to the next state; such an implementation is depicted in Figure 7-11.\nFigure 7-11. Explicit flow variable in view scope usages example\nIn the previous examples, you can see that performing the transition depends on the result of the\nevaluation of the expression in the <evaluate /> element. The expression in that element is a standard EL\nexpression that can be evaluated directly by the EL; it does not need to be enclosed in delimiters such as #{ }.\nThe delimiters are not needed when the expression is a string that represents a method call or property access,\nand using them will throw an IllegalArgumentException.\nThe delimiters are only needed when the argument string is a template EL expression that implies\nmixing literal text with one or more standard expressions, as in the redirect link for the end state in previous\nexamples.\n<flow ...>\n<end-state id=\"finish\"\nview=\"externalRedirect:contextRelative:/person/#{person.id}\" />\n</flow>\nConversation Variables\nThe conversation scope is the widest web flow scope. Variables defined within this scope are available to\nsubflows too. The conversation variables are similar to global variables and have the same disadvantages.\nConversation variables introduce a dependency between top-level flows and their subflows; that’s why the\nrecommendation is to not use them if a different option exists. When working with subflows, input/output\nparameters can be used to avoid conversation variables. A variable can be assigned to the conversation\nscope using the <evaluate /> element.\n284\nChapter 7 ■ Spring Web FloW\nIn the following example, a Person instance retrieved using a PersonManager service is being assigned\nto the conversation scope:\n<flow ...>\n<!-- The result of this expression is stored into the person variable -->\n<evaluate result=\"conversationScope.person\"\nexpression=\"personManager.findById(personId)\"/>\n</flow>\nRequest and Flash Scopes\nAttributes placed in flash scope exist through the life of the current request and until the next view\nrendering. After the view renders, the flash scope is cleared. Flash scope is typically used to store messages\nthat should be preserved until after the next view renders. This scope is useful to pass data from one request\nto another as one flow state involves two requests, as depicted in Figure 7-4.\n• The first request lasts between the transition from the current state until entering the\nnext state.\n• The second lasts from the moment before the view is rendered to the end of\nrendering the same state.\nYou can consider the flash scope as an extension of the request scope in the Web Flow context, because\nthe request scope is not quite useful when using web flow, as is explained later in this section.\nAttributes placed in request scope exist for the life of the current request into the flow execution. When\nthe request ends, any attributes in request scope goes out of scope. Variables should be assigned the request\nscope when their values are refetched every time a state is redisplayed. If the data can be cached, the view\nscope would be more appropriate for the variable.\n■ ! the request scope can be useful when creating a sports betting site. the application should have a web\nflow defined, through which the user can place a bet. a request variable should be used to extract the most\nrecent results of games being played, so the user can be informed in real time of his winning chances.\nAlso, data with request scope can be used in cases where it is needed only to initialize the next view; but\nit should not be displayed by it.\n■ ! Consider the example of a betting site: only the list of games currently being played should be displayed,\nso a specific time interval value can be stored in a variable and used as criteria for selection.\nTo implement the previously mentioned cases, the flow scope can be used, and the games the user\ncan bet on can be retrieved using AJAX calls. Request scope is pretty useless, considering that usually a\ndeveloper is interested in sharing the data between the two requests implied by a web flow state.\n285\nChapter 7 ■ Spring Web FloW\nFigure 7-12 is a simple diagram with the duration of the flash scope and the request scope depicted to\nmake their differences in the context of a flow execution more obvious.\nFigure 7-12. Comparison between request and flash scope\nIn Figure 7-12, you can clearly see the two requests implied by a flow state. One of them is the user\nrequest to start the flow with URL /person/newPerson. Accessing this URL makes the web flow engine send",

The exception is caught by Spring Security servlet filter. Catching or\nsuppressing this exception is not recommended. When extending SimpleMappingExceptionResolver,\ndoResolveException should be implemented so that this exception is rethrown.\nimport\norg.springframework.web.servlet.handler.SimpleMappingExceptionResolver;\npublic class CustomExceptionResolver\nextends SimpleMappingExceptionResolver {\n@Override\nprotected ModelAndView doResolveException\n(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res,\nObject handler, Exception ex) {\nreturn super.doResolveException(req, res, handler, ex);\n}\n}\nThe following example depicts the specific points where the secured element can appear in a flow\ndefinition:\n<!--webflow-config.xml-->\n<!-- 1.

Often,\nthese are specific security roles. But, when using a custom access decision manager, the syntax can vary; for\nexample, SpEL can be used when the custom access manager is a Spring bean that supports them.\nSpring Security is a wide subject; if you intend to use it in your projects, there is a lot of good\ndocumentation available online. Often, complete code samples are provided to help the curious developer\nunderstand how it works and how to use it. And, of course, the starting point is the Spring Security Reference\nat http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/. All that is\ncovered in this book should suffice in helping a developer understand the basic concepts that might be in\nthe certification exam.\nSpring Security with OAuth\nOAuth15 is an open standard for authorization. It is an open protocol to allow secure authorization in a\nsimple and standard method for web, mobile, and desktop applications. It is designed to work with HTTP\nand basically allows access tokens to be generated by a server, which can then be used by the client to access\nresources on another server. It’s like there is an authentication provider that guarantees that you are who you\nsay you are (it vouches for you) to a different service provider.\nWhen talking about OAuth2 (because it is the most commonly used at the moment), the following\ncomponents need to be mentioned:\n• Resource owner: An entity that grants or denies access to a protected resource.\n• Resource server: The server that hosts protected resources; it is capable of accepting\nand responding to requests done with an access token.\n• Client: The entity that requests protected resources on behalf of the owner. It can be\na web application, a mobile application, or a client-side application (JavaScript).\n• AuthorizationServer: A server that provides access tokens to the client after a\nsuccessful authentication.\n15The project’s official page is at http://projects.spring.io/spring-security-oauth/.\n353\nChapter 7 ■ Spring Web FloW\nFor example, if you have a Google account, you can install Runtastic (a sport tracker application) on\nyour phone and access that application using your Google account without exposing the Google password\nprocess, as shown in Figure 7-26.\nFigure 7-26. Google as authentication provider for Runtastic\nIn the previous example, Google is the authorization server, the user is the client, the Runtastic\napplication is the resource owner/resource server. But most applications—like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn,\nand GitHub—implement the authorization and resource server role.\nCurrently, Spring Security can be integrated with OAuth (1a) and OAuth2. A library is provided for each\nversion; it needs to be included in the classpath of the application: spring-security-oauth for OAuth(1a)\nand spring-security-oauth2 for OAuth2. OAuth is a simple way to publish and interact with protected\ndata. A lot of information about OAuth and what it can be used for can be found by searching the Internet.\nThe main idea is that using OAuth can give certain resources access without providing a username and\npassword to the server.\nTo configure a Spring application as an authorization server, in a @Configuration class\nextending org.springframework.security.oauth2.config.annotation.web.configuration.\nAuthorizationServerConfigurerAdapter, the configure method must be overridden with\nan implementation that sets up the clients that can access the server. Extending the previously\nmentioned class provides empty method implementations for definitions inherited from the\nAuthorizationServerConfigurer interface (same package as the implementing class), making the job\neasier for the developer. The class must be annotated with @EnableAuthorizationServer, which is a\nconvenient annotation provided by Spring to enable an authorization server.\nAlso, the Spring Security authentication manager (configured in the Spring Security configuration class\nannotated with @EnableWebSecurity) is injected here to secure the authorization end point.\nimport o.s.security.oauth2.config.annotation.web.configuration.*;\nimport o.s.security.oauth2.config.annotation.web.configurers.*;\n@Configuration\n@EnableAuthorizationServer\nprotected static class OAuth2Config extends AuthorizationServerConfigurerAdapter {\n@Autowired\nprivate AuthenticationManager authenticationManager;\n354\nChapter 7 ■ Spring Web FloW\n@Override (1)\npublic void configure(AuthorizationServerEndpointsConfigurer endpoints)\nthrows Exception {\nendpoints.authenticationManager(authenticationManager);\n}\n@Override (2)\npublic void configure(ClientDetailsServiceConfigurer clients)\nthrows Exception {\nclients.inMemory()\n// client Id is used by OAuth to identify the client\n.withClient(\"client-with-secret\")\n// grant types that are authorized for the client to use,\n//by default value is empty.\n.authorizedGrantTypes(\"password\", \"client_credentials\")\n// roles that client must have in order to access the resource\n.authorities(\"ROLE_USER\")\n//comma separated rights to the resource, by default none is specified\n.scopes(\"read\", \"trust\")\n//The secret associated with the resource, by default, no secret is empty\n.secret(\"12#23$\");\n}\n}\nThe first configure method (1) injects the Spring Security authentication manager (set up in\n@EnableWebSecurity as in normal Spring Security), which is needed for the password grant defined tin the\nsecond method.\nThe second configure method (2) sets up the clients that can access the server, and their properties.\nTo implement the resource server, another configuration class is needed; this one must be annotated\nwith @EnableResourceServer, which is a convenient annotation for OAuth2 resource servers, enabling a\nSpring Security filter that authenticates requests via an incoming OAuth2 token. The class is recommended\nto extend the org.springframework.security.oauth2.config.annotation.web.configuration.\nResourceServerConfigurerAdapter, which provides empty implementation for methods inherited from the\nResourceServerConfigurer interface (same package), making a developer’s job easier.\nimport o.s.security.oauth2.config.annotation.web.configuration.*;\nimport o.s.security.oauth2.config.annotation.web.configurers.*;\n@Configuration\n@EnableResourceServer\nprotected static class ResourceServer extends ResourceServerConfigurerAdapter {\n@Override\npublic void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {\nhttp\n.requestMatchers().antMatchers(\"/\",\"/admin/beans\").and()\n.authorizeRequests()\n.anyRequest().access(\"#oauth2.hasScope('read')\");\n}\n}\n355\nChapter 7 ■ Spring Web FloW\nThe configure method is used to set up resources for OAuth2 protection. Access to the resources is\nset up using the HttpSecurity bean, which is not something new, as it was used in previous examples to\nsecure resources. But what is new here is the fact that access to resources can be configured using Spring\nSecurity Expressions that are applied on the oauth2 security object. For example, the expression #oauth2.\nhasScope('read') tests the resource reading rights for the client the oauth2 object is associated with. The\nexpression handler is enabled by the @EnableResourceServer annotation.\nThe authorization and resource server application is usually an application that receives REST requests;\nthere is really no need for an interface of any kind. The client application can be any type of application, but\nmost of the time it is a web or mobile application.\nWhen opening the Runtastic site or mobile application, a method of authentication can be selected. If\nauthentication using a Google account is selected, the user must provide its Google credentials, which are\nsent to the Google authentication server to confirm their validity and send the confirmation to Runtastic.\nBut Runtastic needs to access the user account information and use it to customize its interface to the user’s\npreferences on the Google account. The confirmation received earlier is actually an access code that can be\nused to exchange for an access token that defines what information Google is willing to share about the user.\nTechnically speaking, the OAuth2 interaction between a web application and an authorization server\nimplies the following steps:\n1. User accesses the web client application. The web client application redirects\nthe user to the authorization server. The user logs in and the authorization server\napproves client access to the resource.\n2. Authorization redirects back to the web client with the access code\n3. The web client application exchanges the access code for the access token from\nthe authorization server.\n4. The web client application uses the access token to get resources from the\nresource server.\nSpring Security OAuth is not part of the certification exam as this book is being written, but most web\nand mobile applications require integration with popular social network applications and OAuth is the\ncommunication protocol that makes this interaction quite practical and easier for the end user. So it is best\nto have a basic idea on how this can be done. If you are interested in expanding your knowledge about it,\nthere are some very good resources available at projects.spring.io/spring-security-oauth/docs/\noauth2.html.\nSpring Social Projects\nThe beginning of this book presented a list of the Spring projects currently in development. By the time\nthis book is published, that list will likely be deprecated: some of the projects were dropped, some were\nsplit into smaller projects, and some matured into solid frameworks. One the projects that matured into a\nsolid framework is Spring Social, which provides an API to connect Spring applications to third-party APIs\nfor social networks like Facebook, Twitter, and others. In the century of Web 2.0 and Big Data, connecting\napplications and sharing information in a practical way is a necessity. So Spring decided to start this project\nto help web applications developed in Spring integrate with SaaS (Software as a Service) API providers\nsuch as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. Currently under work, there are also integration modules for\nGitHub and Tripit. The communication is done using the service type provided by any of the mentioned\napplications. Most of them use REST. Facebook uses its own type of communication called the Facebook\nGraph. Figure 7-27 depicts all Spring Social projects, the application they communicate with, and with which\nprotocol.\n356\nChapter 7 ■ Spring Web FloW\nFigure 7-27. The Spring Social projects\nSpring Social provides a lot of features designed to make the process of connecting local user accounts\nto hosted provider accounts easy to implement: a controller that handles authorization between the Java/\nSpring application and the service provider, a controller that enables user authentication by signing into a\nservice provider, connection factory classes, real-time callback handlers, and much more.\nMore information on how Spring Social can be used is on the official page of this project at http://\nprojects.spring.io/spring-social/.\nSummary\nAfter completing this chapter, you should be able to\n• Describe what Web Flow is and what problems it solves.\n• Describe the Web Flow architecture.\n• Understand how Web Flow processes a request.\n• Configure Web Flow with Spring MVC.\n• Describe the typical flow implementation guidelines.\n• List the elements of a flow definition.\n• Define flows using the XML language.\n• Test flow execution outside the container.\n• Flow definition best practices.\n• Describe branching.\n• Describe an action-state and how it should be used.\n357\nChapter 7 ■ Spring Web FloW\n• Describe a decision state.\n• Describe how exceptions are handled in Spring Web Flow.\n• Describe and use subflows.\n• Describe and use flow inheritance.\n• Configure Spring Security using XML and Java Config.\n• Use Spring Security to secure parts of JSP pages and methods.\n• Use Spring Security to secure your flows.",

    "question": "class, args);\n}\n}\nBut what if you want the application to be available on a different port and in a different context path?",
    "answer": "There are a few ways to do this.\nThe simplest way is to create a customized bean class that implements the org.springframework.\nboot.context.embedded.EmbeddedServletContainerCustomizer interface and provides a concrete\nimplementation for the customize method:\npackage com.book.init;\nimport org.springframework.boot.context.embedded.ConfigurableEmbeddedServletContainer;\nimport org.springframework.boot.context.embedded.EmbeddedServletContainerCustomizer;\nimport org.springframework.stereotype.Component;\n/**\n* Created by iuliana.cosmina on 9/23/15.\n*/\n@Component\npublic class CustomizationBean implements EmbeddedServletContainerCustomizer {\n@Override\npublic void customize(ConfigurableEmbeddedServletContainer container) {\ncontainer.setPort(8083);\ncontainer.setContextPath(\"/boot\");\n}\n}\nBy adding this bean to the configuration, the application can now be accessed at\nhttp://localhost:8083/boot.\nAnother way to do this is by using a customized factory bean for\nJettyEmbeddedServletContainerFactory. Aside from port and contextPath, some settings for the\noptimization of the embedded Jetty server used to run the application can be provided. The @Bean annotated\nmethod that declares this bean can be added to any configuration class that is taken into consideration by\nSpring Boot.\npackage com.book.init;\nimport org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server;\nimport org.eclipse.jetty.util.thread.QueuedThreadPool;\nimport org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;\nimport org.springframework.boot.context.embedded.jetty.\nJettyEmbeddedServletContainerFactory;\nimport org.springframework.boot.context.embedded.jetty.\nJettyServerCustomizer;\n374\nChapter 8 ■ Spring Boot and WeBSoCket\nimport org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;\nimport org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;\n/**\n* Created by iuliana.cosmina on 9/27/15.\n*/\n@Configuration\npublic class JettyFactoryConfig {\n@Bean\npublic JettyEmbeddedServletContainerFactory\njettyServletContainerFactory(@Value(\"${server.port:8085}\") final String port,\n@Value(\"${jetty.threadPool.maxThreads:200}\") final String maxThreads,\n@Value(\"${jetty.threadPool.minThreads:8}\") final String minThreads,\n@Value(\"${jetty.threadPool.idleTimeout:60000}\") final String idleTimeout) {\nfinal JettyEmbeddedServletContainerFactory factory =\nnew JettyEmbeddedServletContainerFactory(Integer.valueOf(port));\nfactory.setContextPath(\"/boot\");\nfactory.addServerCustomizers(new JettyServerCustomizer() {\n@Override\npublic void customize(final Server server) {\n// Customize the connection pool used by Jetty to handle\n//incoming HTTP connections\nfinal QueuedThreadPool threadPool =\nserver.getBean(QueuedThreadPool.class);\nthreadPool.setMaxThreads(Integer.valueOf(maxThreads));\nthreadPool.setMinThreads(Integer.valueOf(minThreads));\nthreadPool.setIdleTimeout(Integer.valueOf(idleTimeout));\n}\n});\nreturn factory;\n}\n}\nBy adding this bean to the configuration, the application can now be accessed at\nhttp://localhost:8085/boot.\nValues for the customizations can be provided, directly as done before, but they also can be provided\nusing properties files or YAML files. In order to provide the configuration via a properties file, a file named\napplication.properties has to be created and applied to the application from the outside, or it can be\npackaged in the jar. If multiple profiles are used, multiple files can be added. Their naming matches the\napplication-{profile}.properties template.\nSpringApplication looks for an application.properties file in the following locations, and adds them\nto the Spring environment:\n• a /config directory under the current directory\n• the current directory\n• a classpath /config package\n• the classpath root\n375\nChapter 8 ■ Spring Boot and WeBSoCket\nBeing a resource file, application.properties must be located during development under\nsrc/main/resources.\nThe preceding list is ordered by precedence, so Spring Boot looks for property files by traversing the list\nfrom top to bottom. The first properties file found is taken into consideration, and it does not matter if the\nsubsequent locations have a properties file defined.\nThe default name of the properties file is application.properties. Spring Boot looks for it, unless it\nwas changed by setting the environment variable named spring.config.name.\nThe location of the file can also be provided as the value for the environment variable named\nspring.config.location.\nSo if the 08-chapter-02-solution application is packaged into a runnable jar called boot.jar, the\napplication could be run from the command line with the following arguments:\n#Spring Boot will search in the classpath for a file named boot.properties\n$ java -jar boot.jar --spring.config.name=boot\n#Spring Boot will read the properties the specified file\n$ java -jar boot.jar --spring.config.location=/Users/myuser/config/default.properties\nIn the preceding example, the file is saved under book-code/08-chapter-02-solution/src/main/\nresources and has the following contents:\n#application.properties\napp.port=8084\napp.context=/boot\nThese property values are injected using the @Value annotation into a customization bean that is picked\nup and used by Spring Boot. The application is then accessed at http://localhost:8084/boot.\npackage com.book.init;\nimport org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;\nimport org.springframework.boot.context.embedded.ConfigurableEmbeddedServletContainer;\nimport org.springframework.boot.context.embedded.EmbeddedServletContainerCustomizer;\nimport org.springframework.stereotype.Component;\n@Component\npublic class PropertiesConfBean implements EmbeddedServletContainerCustomizer {\n@Value(\"${app.port}\")\nprivate Integer value;\n@Value(\"${app.context}\")\nprivate String contextPath;\n@Override\npublic void customize(ConfigurableEmbeddedServletContainer container) {\ncontainer.setPort(value);\ncontainer.setContextPath(contextPath);\n}\n}\n376\nChapter 8 ■ Spring Boot and WeBSoCket\nThe EmbeddedServletContainerCustomizer interface is used for customizing autoconfigured\nembedded servlet containers. Any beans of this type are instantiated and used to initialize the configuration\nof the embedded server before the container itself is started.\nWithout an EmbeddedServletContainerCustomizer bean, the contents of application.properties\nlook different, because they must match the standard property names3 that Spring Boot looks for, as follows:\n#application.properties\nserver.port=8084\nserver.context-path=/boot\nWhen the snakeyaml library is in the classpath, YAML files can be used instead of properties files.\nYAML is a well-known format within the Ruby community. It is a superset of JSON, and as such, it is\na very convenient format for specifying hierarchical configuration data. In the previous example, if\nthe application.properties file is replaced by application.yml, with the following contents, the\nbehavior will be exactly the same, because the internal org.springframework.beans.factory.config.\nYamlPropertiesFactoryBean converts the contents of the YAML file into the properties in the initial\napplication.properties file.\n#application.yml\napp:\nport:8082\ncontext:/boot\n■ ! Both application.properties and application.yml can be used in the same project, because for\nbigger projects, the configuration list could be quite large and migration could be a long duration process; it is\nconvenient to be able to do the migration gradually. Be careful not to have the same properties defined in both\nfiles, because if this happens, properties defined in application.properties take precedence.\nYAML properties can be used in a different way. A class can be designed to have its fields initialized\nfrom a YAML file. The following AppSettings class is such a class.\npackage com.book.init;\nimport org.slf4j.Logger;\nimport org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;\nimport org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties;\nimport javax.annotation.PostConstruct;\nimport javax.validation.constraints.NotNull;\n@ConfigurationProperties(prefix=\"app\")\npublic class AppSettings {\nprivate static Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(AppSettings.class);\n@NotNull\nprivate Integer port;\n3The property names standard list for application.properties or application.yml is at http://docs.spring.io/\nspring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#common-application-properties.\n377\nChapter 8 ■ Spring Boot and WeBSoCket\n@NotNull\nprivate String context;\npublic Integer getPort() {\nreturn port;\n}\npublic void setPort(Integer port) {\nthis.port = port;\n}\npublic String getContext() {\nreturn context;\n}\npublic void setContext(String context) {\nthis.context = context;\n}\npublic AppSettings() {\n}\n@PostConstruct\npublic void check() {\nlogger.info(\"Initialized {} {}\", port, context);\n}\n}\nThe annotation that allows this is @ConfigurationProperties, which marks a class to be used for\ninitialization with property values by the Spring DataBinder utilities. The advantage here is that usage of\nthe @Value annotation and hard-coding the property names is avoided. Validators can also be added on\nthe fields (notice the @NotNull annotations).\nThe prefix attribute is used to refer to the parent element in the YAML file. This bean is then autowired\ninto the YamlConfBean, which uses its properties as needed.\npackage com.book.init;\nimport org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;\nimport org.springframework.boot.context.embedded.ConfigurableEmbeddedServletContainer;\nimport org.springframework.boot.context.embedded.EmbeddedServletContainerCustomizer;\nimport org.springframework.stereotype.Component;\n@Component\npublic class YamlConfBean implements EmbeddedServletContainerCustomizer {\n@Autowired\nprivate AppSettings appSettings;\n378\nChapter 8 ■ Spring Boot and WeBSoCket\n@Override\npublic void customize(ConfigurableEmbeddedServletContainer container) {\ncontainer.setPort(appSettings.getPort());\ncontainer.setContextPath(appSettings.getContext());\n}\n}\nFor Spring Boot to know to create and initialize a bean of type AppSettings, a modification must be\nmade to the Application class. The @EnableConfigurationProperties (AppSettings.class) annotation\nmust be added to the class definition at the same level as @SpringBootApplication. If the class name\n(AppSettings in this case) is not specified in the annotation, Spring Boot will scan, create, and initialize\nbeans of all classes annotated with ConfigurationProperties.\npackage com.book.init;\nimport org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;\nimport org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;\nimport org.springframework.boot.context.properties.EnableConfigurationProperties;\nimport org.springframework.context.annotation.ComponentScan;\n@SpringBootApplication\n@ComponentScan(basePackages = {\"com.book.init\", \"com.book.web\"})\n@EnableConfigurationProperties(AppSettings.class)\npublic class Application {\npublic static void main(String args) {\nSpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);\n}\n}\nWhen using Spring Boot, a Spring ASCII banner is printed in the console at application startup, like the\none shown in Figure 8-3.\nFigure 8-3. Spring Boot console banner\n379\nChapter 8 ■ Spring Boot and WeBSoCket\nThis too can be customized. The instructions can be found in the official documentation at\nhttp://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.2.6.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-banner.\nA banner.txt file needs to be created under the resources directory; a text-to-ASCII generator should be\nused to create the desired banner. The one presented in module 08-chapter-03-solution is shown\nin Figure 8-4.\nFigure 8-4. Apress Spring Boot console banner\nImporting Additional Configuration Elements\nIf an application is migrated to Spring Boot, a lot of the configuration classes and even XML configuration\nelements can be imported into the Spring Boot configuration class. Additional configuration classes\ncan be imported using the @Import annotation or by adding a @ComponentScan to the Spring Boot core\ninitialization class (the one with the main method in it) and setting the basePackages attribute value with\nthe package name where the class can be found, which ensures that Spring automatically picks up all Spring\ncomponents, including @Configuration classes.\nXML configuration can be imported using the @ImportResource annotation, as the Spring Boot\ninitialization class is nothing more than a more complex @Configuration class.\nif you are using a Unix system, you can also test the examples attached to the chapter using the curl\ncommand. Just open a console and execute:\ncurl localhost:8080/boot\n#modify port or contextPath accordingly\nin the console, you should see an output similar to what you see in the browser.\n380\nChapter 8 ■ Spring Boot and WeBSoCket\nRunning Spring Boot Applications\nThe main difference between using Spring Boot and developing web applications in the typical way is that\nwhen the Gradle spring-boot plugin is used, a web archive (*.war) is no longer created, because there is no\nneed for it. The war file is strictly a deployable file that needs to be run using a web server or an application\nserver. Spring Boot can be used to have an embedded server in the application. So when the Gradle\nspring-boot plugin is used instead of a war, an executable Java archive (*.jar) is created.\nThe created archive can be found under the [project_root]/build/libs and can be executed just\nlike any jar. In the 08-chapter-03-solution.gradle configuration file, there is the line jar.archiveName =\n\"boot.jar\", which is used to specify the name of the final archive. Without it, the name of the resulting jar\nwould be 08-chapter-03-solution.jar, which is long and unpractical.\nTo build the project, create the jar and then execute the application. The following lines can be executed\nin the console (shell or command prompt):\n#this will work only if you have Gradle installed on the system\n$ gradle clean build\n$ java -jar build/libs/boot.jar",

    "question": "But what if we want the result to be a web archive that should be deployed on an application server or a\nweb server?",
    "answer": "That can be done too, in three simple steps:\n1. Modify the application to provide a Servlet initializer for the servlet environment.\nThis is done by making the class annotated with @SpringBootApplication to\nextend the Spring Boot convenient class org.springframework.boot.context.\nweb.SpringBootServletInitializer and overriding its configure method:\n@SpringBootApplication\n@ComponentScan(basePackages = {\"com.book.init\", \"com.book.web\"})\n@EnableConfigurationProperties(AppSettings.class)\npublic class Application extends SpringBootServletInitializer {\n@Override\nprotected SpringApplicationBuilder\nconfigure(SpringApplicationBuilder application) {\nreturn application.sources(Application.class);\n}\npublic static void main(String args) {\nSpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);\n}\n}\n2. Leave all the Spring Boot components as dependencies, but use the Gradle\nwar plugin. (Basically, replace apply plugin: 'spring-boot' with apply\nplugin: 'war'.)\n381\nChapter 8 ■ Spring Boot and WeBSoCket\n3. Set the embedded server dependency as provided:\napply plugin: 'war'\nwar.archiveName = \"boot.war\"\nbuildscript {\nrepositories {\nmavenCentral()\n}\ndependencies {\nclasspath boot.springBootPlugin\n}\n}\ndependencies {\ncompile (boot.starterWeb){\nexclude module : \"spring-boot-starter-tomcat\"\n}\ncompile boot.actuator, boot.yaml\nprovidedCompile boot.starterJetty\n//previous 2 lines replaced:\n//compile boot.starterJetty, boot.actuator, boot.yaml\ntestCompile misc.junit, misc.hamcrestCore,\nmisc.hamcrestLib, boot.starterTest\n}\nAfter these changes, if the project is built under the build/libs directory, a boot.war should be created\nthat can be deployed on any web or application server.\n■ ! try to modify the configurations for the 08-chapter-03-solution to create a deployable war, as\ndescribed before. You can use Jetty to run the war on by adding the gretty plugin that was used in the examples\nfor this book until Spring Boot was introduced, by adding\napply from:\n'https://raw.github.com/akhikhl/gretty/master/pluginScripts/gretty.plugin'\nin the 08-chapter-03-solution.gradle file, and then running the appStart gradle task.\nWhen deploying the war to an application server or a web server, keep in mind that the relevant embedded\nserver settings read from the application.yml file are ignored (because they are relevant only to Spring\nBoot) when a class annotated with @SpringBootApplication is used to run the application; so the application\nis available on the port and location that you set for that server. When using gretty, the location that your\napplication can be accessed is printed in the console log.\n...\nINFO Jetty 9.2.10.v20150310 started and listening on port 8080\nINFO 08-chapter-03-solution runs at:\nINFO http://localhost:8080/08-chapter-03-solution\n...\n382\nChapter 8 ■ Spring Boot and WeBSoCket\nTesting Spring Boot Applications\nApplications built with Spring Boot can be tested using unit tests. Spring Boot provides a library to do just\nthat in the most practical manner possible. It is called spring-boot-starter-test. It must be added as a\ndependency of the project to use it.\nAs for common Spring Web applications, the servlet context must be mocked, and only the controller\nbehavior is tested. The HelloWorldController is too simple to test, so a proper one is needed.\n@RestController\npublic class MessageController {\n@Value(\"${app.message:Hello World}\")\nprivate String message = \"Hello World\";\n@RequestMapping(\"/message\")\npublic String message(){\nreturn message;\n}\n}\nThe default value for the message property is set to Hello World, if it is not present in the application.yml file:",

The MockMvcBuilders\nutility class is used to instantiate the controller instance that is to be tested.\nIn Chapter 3, MockitoJUnitRunner.class was used to test a controller, but the Spring Test library offers\nmore appropriate and intuitive methods, especially for REST controllers.\nThe MockMvc should be familiar from Chapter 3.

    "question": "Wouldn’t it be nice if the server could send a message to the browser to inform\nthe user that his order cannot be processed, saving him from wasting time inserting data into the form?",
    "answer": "There are workarounds that can be implemented to implement this type of behavior, such as HTTP\nlong polling, which is a technique involving the client to poll the server for new information and the server\nto keep that request open until new data is available. But this technique might cause trouble when the\nconnection between the client and the server gets interrupted frequently (like when switching between\nWi-Fi and cellular networks); messages get lost and the server might keep requests open that no longer\nneed to be. To overcome these situations, a communication management system must be implemented—so\nthings get even more complicated.\nTo provide a proper and practical solution, the WebSocket protocol was standardized in 2011 as RFC\n6455.4 Most web browsers now implement a client API that supports it. As the official documentation says:\n“The goal of this technology is to provide a mechanism for browser-based applications that need two-way\ncommunication with servers that does not rely on opening multiple HTTP connections.”\nSpring WebSocket Implementation\nOracle has released JSR 356 as part of the JEE7 standard. It is the Java API for WebSocket that should be\nimplemented to integrate WebSocket into web applications on the Java client and server sides. Client\napplications can be developed in any technology, and as long as they are compliant with the RFC 6455, they\nwill be able to communicate with the server. The situation and the possibilities are depicted in Figure 8-5.\nFigure 8-5. A client-server application leveraging WebSocket schema\nIn Spring 4.1, a module named spring-websocket was introduced to provide support for WebSocket-\nbased, two-way communication between the client and the server in web applications. The implementation is\na JSR-356-compatible Java WebSocket API and it also includes SockJS-based fallback options. The SockJS is a\nJavaScript library that provides a WebSocket-like object (WebSocket behavior is emulated). It is most suitable\nwhen the application needs to be supported in older browsers that do not support the WebSocket protocol.\nThe Spring Framework WebSocket infrastructure is based on the Spring Messaging Foundation.\nInfrastructure beans like MessageChannel and MessageHandler are used as building blocks for the\nWebSocket environment.\n4https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455\n386\nChapter 8 ■ Spring Boot and WeBSoCket\nIn the spring-messaging module, support for STOMP5 was added, providing an annotation\nprogramming model for routing and processing messages from WebSocket clients. This means that controller\nmethods can be used to process HTTP requests (when methods are annotated with @RequestMapping) and\ncan also be used to process WebSocket messages when methods are annotated with @MessageMapping, an\nannotation that was introduced in Spring 4.0.\nThe complementary operation, sending the result of the method back to the client, is implemented\nusing the @SendTo annotation, which is used to mark a subscription endpoint to which all the potential\nclients are registered; this way, they are identified as receivers of messages from the server. The\ncommunication between clients and the server application using the WebSocket protocol is asynchronous,\nand when the server is overloaded, it can have delays in sending the messages.\nThe WebSocket protocol is streaming, and messages can be sent to/received from a WebSocket at the\nsame time, so a connection and a WebSocketSession implementation is needed to provide the infrastructure\nthrough which the messages will be exchanged.\nThe following are the steps to create a WebSocket-compliant application using Spring WebSocket:\n1. Define the format for the STOMP message and the POJO to model it.\n2. Define the format for the server reply message and the POJO to model it.\n3. Create a message-handling controller.\n4. Configure Spring for WebSocket communication handling.\n5. Create a client application.\n6. Create an executable server application.\nTo get familiarized with WebSocket Spring components, you’ll follow steps to create a mIRC6-like\napplication that uses the WebSocket protocol. The application will be quite simple: it will require a\nusername to allow connection to the server, but no authentication will be implemented. The server will\nreceive messages from users and redistribute them to all connected clients. The server will communicate\nthe time every 60 seconds and it will censor bad words, like bomb and murder. The source code to do this is\nexplained later in the section.\n[STEP 1] The STOMP message is a JSON representation containing the username and a message that\nthe sends to the server:\n{\n'name' : 'jules',\n'content' : 'Hello World!'\n}\nThe POJO is quite simple and contains two properties (the JSON key names from the previous snippet)\nand getters.\npackage com.book.ws;\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty;\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonPropertyOrder;\n@JsonPropertyOrder({ \"name\", \"content\"})\npublic class ChatMessage {\n5STOMP is an acronym for Simple Text-Orientated Messaging Protocol. It defines a message format that any available\nSTOMP clients can use to communicate with any STOMP server application. Basically, it represents a standard\ncommunication unit independent of languages and platforms.\n6A popular Internet Relay Chat (IRC) used extensively in the 1990s (see http://www.mirc.com).\n387\nChapter 8 ■ Spring Boot and WeBSoCket\n@JsonProperty(\"content\")\nprivate String content;\n@JsonProperty(\"name\")\nprivate String name;\npublic String getName() {\nreturn name;\n}\npublic String getContent() {\nreturn content;\n}\n}\nJSON-specific annotations can be used, so POJO fields can be named differently than the key names in\nthe JSON message and can also be used to customize the serialization. For example, the @JsonPropertyOrder\nis used here to define ordering of properties at serialization time. In the previous code, the annotation ensures\nthat the resulting JSON object will always have “name” as the first property and “content” as the second.\n■ ! the JSon annotations are used abusively in the previous example, simply for demonstration purposes. as\nthe field names of the class are one and the same with the JSon property names, the @JsonProperty can be\nremoved because it doesn’t have any effect on the code. the same goes for the @JsonPropertyOrder, which can\nbe removed because the order of the properties in the resulting JSon object is not really important in this case.\n[STEP 2] Upon receiving a ChatMessage and extracting the information, the server application\nprocesses it and responds with a ServerMessage instance that is sent to a separate queue that the client is\nsubscribed to. The response is serialized to a JSON representation. Defining a format for the server is easy in\na mIRC application; all that is needed is a JSON representation with one property:\n{\n'content' : 'It is 18:13'\n}\nThe POJO class that will be serialized could look like this:\npackage com.book.ws;\npublic class ServerMessage {\nprivate String content;\npublic ServerMessage(String content) {\nthis.content = content;\n}\npublic String getContent() {\nreturn content;\n}\n}\n388\nChapter 8 ■ Spring Boot and WeBSoCket\nSpring uses the Jackson JSON library to serialize and deserialize instances used for WebSocket\ncommunication.\n[STEP 3] Creating a message-handling controller is also quite easy when using the @MessageMapping\n@SendTo annotations.\npackage com.book.ws;\nimport org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;\nimport org.springframework.messaging.handler.annotation.MessageMapping;\nimport org.springframework.messaging.handler.annotation.SendTo;\nimport java.util.Random;\n@Controller\npublic class ChatController {\n@MessageMapping(\"/mirc\")\n@SendTo(\"/topic/chat\")\npublic ServerMessage process(ChatMessage message) throws Exception {\n//generate random lag\nRandom rn = new Random();\nThread.sleep((rn.nextInt(5) + 1) * 1000);\nreturn MessageProcessor.build(message);\n}\n}\nThe MessageProcessor is a utility class used to build the ServerMessage instances, which is serialized\nand sent to the client. The implementation is not really relevant for this section, as it only contains a static\nmethod used to build a ServerMessage instance based on a ChatMessage instance.\npackage com.book.ws;\npublic class MessageProcessor {\npublic static ServerMessage build(ChatMessage message) {\nif (message.getContent() != null && !message.getContent().isEmpty()) {\nif (message.getContent().contains(\"bomb\")) {\n//censoring using string.replace(...)\nreturn new ServerMessage\n(\"[\" + message.getName() + \"]: \"\n+ message.getContent().replace(\"bomb\", \"****\"));\n} else if (message.getContent().contains(\"murder\")) {\n//censoring using string.replace(...)\nreturn new ServerMessage\n(\"[\" + message.getName() + \"]: \"\n+ message.getContent().replace(\"murder\", \"****\"));\n}\nreturn new ServerMessage\n(\"[\" + message.getName() + \"]: \" + message.getContent());\n}\nreturn new ServerMessage(\"[server]: Welcome \" +message.getName());\n}\n}\n389\nChapter 8 ■ Spring Boot and WeBSoCket\nIn the preceding code snippet, the process method is mapped to the destination \"mirc\", so if a\nmessage is sent to this destination, the method is called. This behavior is provided by annotating the method\nwith @MessageMapping(\"/mirc\") . Any message received from the client application(s) is deserialized,\nresulting in a ChatMessage instance that is used as an argument for the process method call.\nThe Thread.sleep call is used to simulate a delay. The Random instance is used to generate a\nrandom duration for the delay with a maximum of 5 seconds. This artifice was added to demonstrate that\ncommunication between the client application and the server is indeed asynchronous.\nSpring WebSocket Configuration\n[STEP 4] To configure Spring for WebSocket communication handling with STOMP messages, a\nconfiguration class needs to be created.\npackage com.book.init;\nimport org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;\nimport org.springframework.messaging.simp.config.MessageBrokerRegistry;\nimport org.springframework.web.socket.config.annotation.\nAbstractWebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer;\nimport org.springframework.web.socket.config.annotation.EnableWebSocketMessageBroker;\nimport org.springframework.web.socket.config.annotation.StompEndpointRegistry;\n@Configuration\n@EnableWebSocketMessageBroker\npublic class WebSocketConfig extends AbstractWebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer {\n@Override\npublic void configureMessageBroker(MessageBrokerRegistry config) {\nconfig.enableSimpleBroker(\"/topic\");\nconfig.setApplicationDestinationPrefixes(\"/app\");\n}\n@Override\npublic void registerStompEndpoints(StompEndpointRegistry registry) {\nregistry.addEndpoint(\"/mirc\").withSockJS()\n.setStreamBytesLimit(512 * 1024)\n.setHttpMessageCacheSize(1000)\n.setDisconnectDelay(30 * 1000);\n}\n}\nEach of the elements in the previous class declaration has a specific responsibility. The following\ndescribes each of them.\n• @EnableWebSocketMessageBroker enables WebSocket message handling using a\nmessage broker.\nAbstractWebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer is a Spring convenient class\nimplementing the WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer interface to provide\nempty method bodies for optional methods that are now needed for a minimal\nconfiguration of a WebSocket application.\n390\nChapter 8 ■ Spring Boot and WeBSoCket\n• The configureMessageBroker() method implementation is used to configure a\nmessage broker. The config.enableSimpleBroker(\"/topic\") enables a simple\nmemory-based message broker used to filter destinations prefixed with \"/topic\"\ntargeting the broker. The config.setApplicationDestinationPrefixes(\"/app\")\nmethod designates the prefix for messages that need to be handled by methods\nannotated with @MessageMapping.\n• The registerStompEndpoints() registers the \"/mirc\" STOMP endpoint, and\nenables and configures the SockJS fallback options. The subsequent chained method\ncalls are used to configure streaming details.\nStreaming transports save responses on the client side and do not free the\nmemory occupied by delivered messages, so the connection needs to be recycled\nfrom time to time. WebSocket communication is based on HTTP Streaming,\nwhich works by pushing content continuously to browser. The memory usage\nis kept accumulated in browser. Basically, the browser needs to close and\nreconnect the streaming channel to release memory. So there are a limited\nnumber of bytes that can be sent before the HTTP streaming connection is closed.\nThe default value set by SockJS is 128K; the .setStreamBytesLimit(512 * 1024)\ncall sets it to 512K.\nThe number of server-to-client messages that can be cached in a session waiting\nfor the next HTTP request polling is also limited. The default is 100 and it is set by\nthe web server; the .setHttpMessageCacheSize(1000) call sets it to 1000.\nThe number of milliseconds after an inactive client is disconnected is 5 seconds\nand it is set by the web server, but the .setDisconnectDelay(30 * 1000) call\nsets it to 30.\nTo use all of these elements, the spring-websocket and spring-messaging libraries must be added\nas dependencies. When using Spring Boot, only the spring-boot-starter-websocket dependency is\nnecessary. Spring Boot adds all the necessary dependencies.\nAside from this, the entry point of the application is the com.init.Application class, which is a typical\nboot-up Spring Boot class.\npackage com.book.init;\nimport org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;\nimport org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;\nimport org.springframework.context.annotation.ComponentScan;\n@SpringBootApplication\n@ComponentScan(basePackages = {\"com.book.init, com.book.ws\"})\npublic class Application {\npublic static void main(String args) {\nSpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);\n}\n}\n391\nChapter 8 ■ Spring Boot and WeBSoCket\nWebSocket Client Application\nAs depicted in Figure 8-5, client applications for a Spring WebSocket server application can be written in\nany programming language for which a WebSocket implementation or Socket-compatible implementation\nexists. For the example in this section, the simplest way to create a client application is the plain old HTML\nand JavaScript pair.\n[STEP 5] Creating a browser client application is easy, and for the scope of this book, it is part of the\nsame application and deployed on the same embedded container. The application is a JavaScript client that\nsends and receives messages from the server.\nThe module project for this section can be found under the book-code project and it is called\n08-chapter-04-solution. The module is a Spring Boot WebSocket project organized as follows:\n• The sources for the WebSocket server-application can be found under src/main/java.\nThe configuration classes are placed in the com.book.init package. All classes\ninvolved in WebSocket communication are placed under the com.book.ws package.\n• The sources for the JavaScript client application can be found under src/main/\nresources/static. The client application can be accessed at index.html. The\nfunctions that get called on specific HTML events are all gathered in the index.js\nfile. The JavaScript external libraries used in the project are under the static/ext\ndirectory.\n• jQuery is used to simplify the development of the JavaScript code used to handle\nHTML user events.\n• SockJS is used to emulate WebSocket and provides a WebSocket-like API.\n• The STOMP library is used to help create STOMP messages.\nThe structure of the full Spring Boot WebSocket project is depicted in Figure 8-6.\n392\nChapter 8 ■ Spring Boot and WeBSoCket\nFigure 8-6. The 08-chapter-04-solution project structure\nThe client application when no client is connected is depicted in Figure 8-7.\nFigure 8-7.
